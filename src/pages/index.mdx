  title="Enslavement at the Cape of Good Hope"
  firstSection={true}
>
  From its establishment in the 1650s, the Dutch settlement at the Cape of Good
  Hope relied heavily on enslaved labour. Over some 180 years, the Dutch East
  India Company (VOC) transported some 63 000 persons as chattel across the
  Indian Ocean, from four main areas: Bengal and Sri Lanka; the Indonesian
  archipelago; Madagascar; and the east African coast, especially Mozambique.
  The slave trade was outlawed by the British in 1807 and official abolition
  followed with the Slavery Abolition Act (1833). Emancipation formally took
  effect at the Cape in 1834, at which point a period of indenture or
  ‘apprenticeship’ began (ending in 1838). The Cape colony had passed from Dutch
  to British control in 1806.
  
  What we know about Cape slavery is overwhelmingly framed by the interests of
  the VOC and the Dutch state. Nonetheless, the VOC’s copious archives provide
  detailed insight into the workings – and failings – of the system, as well as
  the lives of those involved. From the many thousands of trials heard in the
  Council of Justice (Raad van Justitie), records of 87 trials were selected by
  Nigel Worden and Gerald Groenewald for detailed rendition and analysis. Their
  edited volume, _Trials of Slavery: selected documents concerning slaves from
  the criminal records of the Council of Justice at the Cape of Good Hope,
  1705-1794_ (Cape Town: Historical Publications Southern Africa [HiPSA,
  formerly Van Riebeeck Society], 2005), gives unique insights into social
  history. Recurrent themes include resistance; desertion and marronage; arson;
  physical violence and threats thereof, including gender-based violence; and
  property crimes. Implicit in the trial documents is evidence of life and work
  on farms and in households, as well as the political imagination of enslaved
  persons.  The selected documents are republished here, in both transcribed
  Dutch and translated English versions, matching the format of the book,
  _Trials of Slavery_. The interpretive material from that book provides readers
  with further insight into these microhistories of Cape slavery.

<LandingPageSection title="Statement on ethics">
As collaborators in this digital republication of the Trials of Slavery we have worked in a spirit of inclusive and reparative scholarship, guided by several principles and beliefs: 
<ul>
  <li>That human costs and undocumented suffering have accompanied enslavement around the globe and throughout history, including the present day; </li>
  <li>That scholarly inquiry opens wounds, old and recent, for descent communities; </li>
  <li>That enslaved ancestry, whether acknowledged as such or not, is often associated with trauma. </li>
</ul>
We acknowledge these systemic injustices. At the same time we hope that our collective work can help explain the lived consequences of inhumane systems and provide a platform for continued inquiry and dialogue. In a spirit of care and respect, we invite engagement on any of the materials presented on this website.

<LandingPageSection title="How to use this resource">
  This website allows you to explore the stories of enslaved individuals. 87
  legal cases are presented in chronological order, from 1704 to 1794, each
  identified by the name of the accused. Each begins with a summary, followed by
  the trial document(s) in English translation with the Dutch original
  alongside, and accompanied by a map. Footnotes provide detailed explanation
  with references, while fuller context is available under the Histories tab.
  You may find recurrent themes (e.g. ‘arson’, ‘theft’) via the tags attached to
  individual cases or via the Search tab.

  The digital republication of these sources was coordinated by Grant Parker:
  the intention was to broaden access to the original volume edited by Nigel
  Worden and Gerald Groenewald, _Trials of Slavery: selected documents concerning
  slaves from the criminal records of the Council of Justice at the Cape of Good
  Hope, 1705-1794_ (2005). 
  
  The website was originally built by Simon Wiles (Stanford University’s Center
  for Interdisciplinary Digital Research, CIDR) on the basis of work done by
  undergraduate interns of the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA):
  Fiona Clunan, Kiana Hu and Victoria (Vicky) Wu. Integration of the website
  into the Archive to Narrative portal was carried out by Stephen Simons.
  
  Input and assistance came from Gerald Groenewald, Antonia Malan, Stefania
  Manfio, Laura J. Mitchell, Alice Parkington, Kerry Ward, and Nigel Worden. 
  
  The main funding that made this project possible came from a Changing Human
  Experience grant of Stanford Public Humanities; subsequent support came from
  the Stanford Accelerator for Learning.
  
  The original documents on which _Trials of Slavery_ drew are housed in the
  Western Cape Archives and Record Service (WCARS), Cape Town.
