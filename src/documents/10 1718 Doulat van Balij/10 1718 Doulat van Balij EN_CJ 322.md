**CJ 322** Criminele Process Stukken, 1718, document 58.

By order of the honourable landdrost *Sieur* Jacob Voet, I, the undersigned, in the presence of the assistant Johannes Keijts, set out to the house and residence of the Prince of Ternate, named Daije Mosis. He (on being questioned by the said Keijts, if he wished to defend his slave, currently under arrest, or to wholly give him up to the Officer) answered that if his slave had committed any crimes, the judge may punish him, and that he gives him up to the judge.

All of which was thus translated to me, the undersigned, by the said Keijts from Malay and Portuguese into Dutch; which I report to have happened.

The Cape of Good Hope on 28 September 1718,

By me, the messenger of the court, \[signed\] Sn. Witmont.

As witness, \[signed\] J. Keijts.
