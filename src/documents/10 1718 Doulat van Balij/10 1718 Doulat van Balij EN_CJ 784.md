# DOULAT VAN BALIJ

**CJ 784** Sententiën, 1717-1725, ff. 64-71.

As Doulat of Balij, 30 years old at a guess, bondsman of Denge Mamouti, Prince of Ternate, and currently their honours’ prisoner, has freely and volutarily confessed and admitted, without any pain or coercion of bonds, of irons, or any threat of suchlike; and moreover, as it has appeared totally evident to the honourable Council of Justice of this government:

That the prisoner, during March of this year, went to the farm of the former landdrost *Sieur* Johannes Mulder, where the prisoner was in a certain small room with one of the slaves named Daniel, who gave the prisoner a rixdollar from a little bag which he had taken from his chest.

That the prisoner went forth from there but, some days afterwards, he again set out there during the evening, on which occasion the prisoner did not scruple to open with a piece of wood the door of the said small room, which (as he claims) was not locked properly. Thereupon he dragged the same chest from which the slave Daniel had handed him the rixdollar out of the house to the back and broke it open from behind with a bit of wood, which he had cut for this purpose; and stole from it nineteen rixdollars in cash, without knowing the specie, as well as an old jacket and six skeins of yarn, leaving the chest there.

That the prisoner, shortly after leaving there, had shown the money to a certain slave of one Christoffel Wit, saying that it was his own. That afterwards the prisoner gave some of this stolen money to his aforementioned master to pay his *maandgeld[^1] * of five rixdollars, as he had been in agreement with him to earn that much every month.

Moreover that the prisoner not only spent the remaining money, but also dumped the jacket and the yarn into the bushes, after which he once again set out (as he admits) to several farms to earn his keep by working.

That the prisoner, on the last day of August this year, crawled on hand and foot along Clapmutsberg to the house of the aforementioned Christoffel Wit and, finding the door there closed, opened it with a pre-prepared piece of wood. He went inside and, finding a chest there, opened it by shaking it and breaking the hinges with a piece of wood. That the prisoner took nothing from the chest, but took from the house three pounds of butter in a napkin, during which operation, he noticed a certain young Hottentot running towards two slaves in the vineyard where they were occupied.

That the prisoner, being afraid, took flight to a wild vineyard close by, from where the slaves asked him to go with them to their master’s house. That when first asked, the prisoner did not do this, but when he was called for the second time by a slave, he went there and ate with them.

That the prisoner set off from there to the farm of the farmer Christoffel Groenewalt, also situated close to the Clapmuts, where he was found by the deputy of the honourable landdrost who wanted to apprehend the prisoner, who, however, escaped from him through the window, wearing only his shirt; in the course of which the prisoner received a wound on his little finger, the result of a blow which the aforesaid deputy gave the prisoner. He left behind a sword, which he had on the bed with him, without though (as he confesses) having any intention to injure anybody.

That the prisoner fled to the bushes around the mountain of Clapmuts and sustained himself with *uijntjes[^2] * until, after nineteen days, he was apprehended on the farm of the aforementioned Christoffel Groenewald \[*sic*\] by Groenewald’s son, one Claas Leckerwijn,[^3] and Pieter Simonsz. Plooij who, after struggling with him for a while, overpowered him and delivered him into the hands of justice.

All of which are matters of the most evil and pernicious consequences, being to the detriment of all good inhabitants and their prosperity, which cannot, under any circumstances, be tolerated in a country where justice is administered, but must be averted and punished most severely, as a deterrent to all such villains.

Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice of this government, serving today, having seen and read the written *crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie*, deliberated by the honourable landdrost Jacob Voet in his official capacity, in addition to the voluntary confession of the prisoner, properly verified in court, and the further documents serving the case, and moreover, having pondered with attention everything which in any way served the case and could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the free and united Netherlands, and having judged the prisoner, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the place where criminal sentences are usually executed here, and there to be handed over to the executioner, to be punished with the rope on the gallows in such a way that death will follow; afterwards that the dead body be taken from there, dragged through their honours’ streets to the outer place of execution, there to be hanged again and to remain like that until being consumed by the air and birds of heaven, with the costs and expenditure of justice.[^4]

Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 13 October 1718.

Pronounced and executed on the 15^th^ thereupon.

[^1]: Some slaves, usually those who lived in Cape Town, were obliged to pay their owners a set amount, known as *koeli geld*, which they had earned by selling goods or doing casual work (Thunberg 1986: 123; Ross 1980: 10-11), and slaves who failed to do so were often punished (see, for example, 1737 Januarij van Tutocorijn). In this case Doulat had agreed to pay his owner a regular monthly payment (*maandgeld)* of five rixdollars. It could not have been easy for slaves to earn such amounts regularly, and this might explain why Doulat stole the money. For more references to examples of *koeli geld* from the eighteenth century, and for comments on the origins of the word, see Franken 1953: 105-6.

[^2]: These are not onions, but probably refer to the corms of a type of iris, the *Moraea fugax* (Iridaceae), which are edible and known to have been used by both the indigenous population and the settlers for food (Thunberg 1986: 55).

[^3]: Not a nickname for somebody fond of wine, but a ‘Dutchification’ of the French surname *Lecrévent* or *Lécrivain.* This Nicholaas Lecrévent was the stepbrother of Christoffel Groenewald’s daughter-in-law, Margaretha Hattingh (Heese & Lombard 1986-2004, vol. 3: 116 and vol. 4: 576).

[^4]: This sentence was recommended in the *eijsch*, CJ 322, document 60, and also recorded in the *regtsrollen*, CJ 7 \[1718\], f. 50.
