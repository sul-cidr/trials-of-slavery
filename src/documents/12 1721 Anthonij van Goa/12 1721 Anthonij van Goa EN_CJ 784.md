# ANTHONIJ VAN GOA

**CJ 784** Sententiën, 1717-1725, ff. 164-69.

Since Anthonij van Goa, 30 years old at a guess, bondsman of the burgher Beatrix Verweij, currently their honours’ prisoner, has voluntarily confessed, without torture or force of bonds, of irons, or even the least threat of suchlike, and since it has appeared evident and clear to the honourable Council of Justice of this government:

That the prisoner was sold by the burgher Jan Oberholster on his public auction to the aforementioned Beatrix Verweij and, having rendered his services there for a period of about two months, obtained (as he asserts) a permission letter[^1] from his said owner to collect his things, which were being taken care of by the slaves of the farmer Jan Jurgen Roos, from there, on which occasion he took along a blanket.

That the prisoner then set out from there to his former master’s post, sleeping a night at that place, after which he resorted to the farm of the farmer Abraham Cloete, both situated around Stellenbosch, where he likewise slept a night, and was provided with food by the slaves at that place, that on the third day after he had gone from his mistress, he was fetched by the *knecht* of the same from this last post and brought back to the aforementioned farm of his mistress, where he was chastised over this staying away. However, the prisoner neither scrupled nor hesitated to run away from his mistress eight days after this and to betake himself to the farm of his former master, the aforementioned Jan Oberholster, where he stayed, during the following day, in a kloof in the mountains around there, and at night with the bondsmen of the aforementioned Oberholster, who also provided him with food, without Oberholster, who had ridden to the Cape, nor the same’s wife, having any knowledge of all these doings.

That the woman slave of the aforenamed Oberholster, named Jannetie – who was the prisoner’s concubine (as he asserts) when he too was living there as a slave, and who had promised him that she would not take another man for as long as he was alive – was also there at the house. When, however, he noticed that she, Jannetie, was lying with another *jongen*, he pushed him away from her and, with the knife which was shown him in court, inflicted a wound in the abdomen of the aforementioned slave, Jannetie, underneath the stomach, about three fingers above the navel, penetrating internally to a depth of five fingers and externally three fingers in length, so that the omentum[^2] hung from the wound a quarter of the way and, moreover, that the inner membrane of the tissue was perforated;[^3] confessing to have done this with the intention to take her life.

That the prisoner after having perpetrated this atrocious wounding, went with the same knife into the nearby thicket and, when people came to take him prisoner, he also wounded himself with that knife, with the intention to also rob himself of his life, in order to escape the public punishment of this monstrous deed in this way. That afterwards the prisoner, after having thrown the knife from him, was taken by the farmers Jan and Claas Louw, as well as Jacob Cloete and Jan van Ellewe, and finally delivered into the hands of justice by the aforementioned Cloete and Jan Louw.

All of which are matters of very great and pernicious consequences which, in a country where justice is practised, may not be tolerated under any circumstances, but must be restrained as an example and a deterrent to other such malicious creatures, and be punished severely.

Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, serving today, having seen and read the written *crimineelen eijsch en conclusie*, drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoner by the honourable landdrost Jacob Voet, in his official capacity, as well as having noted the prisoner’s own voluntary confession, properly verified in court, which was produced with the *eijsch* in order to justify it; further having pondered everything which possibly served the case and could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the free United Netherlands, and having judged the prisoner, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the place where criminal sentences are usually executed here and there, having been handed over to the executioner, to be exposed with a rope around his neck under the gallows, then to be tied to a stake, to be severely scourged with rods on the bare back, thereupon to be branded, besides being riveted in chains for a period of two years, to be sent home to his mistress, provided the same pays the costs and expenditure of justice.

Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 27 March 1721.

Pronounced and executed on the 29^th^ thereupon.
