# ARON VAN MADAGASCAR

**CJ 786** Sententiën, 1736-1743, ff. 88-93.

Since, from the voluntary, verified confession of Aron van Madagascar, 30 years old, slave of the farmer Paul Jourdan, given without any torture or coercion of bonds, of irons, or the least threat of suchlike, it has appeared evident to the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope:

That the prisoner, more than several years ago, then being the slave of the widow Admiraal, was searching for wood on Table Mountain with a bondsman, by the name of Jannuarij. The same Jannuarij had told the prisoner that Leander Boegis, head of the rogues who resided at Vishoek, was present on Table Mountain and had given him, Jannuarij, two *dubbeltjes[^1] * with which to buy flint-stones; which two *dubbeltjes* that slave Jannuarij then handed over to the prisoner, with the request to buy the flint-stones for him, which the prisoner undertook to do; buying, as soon as he had come down from Table Mountain, with the money given him six flint-stones from a *jongen* of the departed burgher Pieter Burij. On the following day, the prisoner, along with the aforementioned Jannuarij, took these flint-stones to the aforementioned slave Leander Boegis, who had with him two muskets and two bondsmen, whom the prisoner did not know. As they were coming towards him, Leander, took aim at them, but seeing, as they came closer, who they were, he kept off. The prisoner later recognised the slave Joumat in Vishoek as having been one of the two *jongens* who accompanied Leander Boegis.[^2]

That the prisoner, more than a full year ago, ran away from his master’s house and, taking off with some *jongens* from Rio de la Goa[^3] in the direction of the beach, eventually arrived above Vishoek, where they took their residence. Which is where the prisoner saw his comrades eating snakes, because of which, as he asserts, he was moved to leave them and continued his journey hither, meeting along the way the slaves Joumat, Adam and the recently executed Jamboe, from whom the prisoner, after staying there for two or three days, went away and came back to the Cape with the kettle of the aforesaid Jamboe, which he had stolen from him.

And considering that such crimes, which are not conducive to the general peace and which serve as encouragement and support for such vagabonds and villains, cannot remain unpunished, but ought to be punished most rigorously as an example to others.

Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, serving today, having carefully read and seen the written *crimineelen eijsch en conclusie* drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoner by the honourable independent fiscal, *Meester* Daniel van Henghel, in his official capacity and, further, having noted the voluntary, verified confession of the prisoner; moreover, having considered everything which served this case and which could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the free United Netherlands and, having judged the prisoner Aron van Madagascar, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the place of justice here, and there to be handed over to the executioner, to be thoroughly scourged on the bare back and to be branded, thereafter to be riveted in chains, in which to labour for a period of ten years on the honourable Company’s public works without payment, with further sentencing by the Council to the costs and expenditure of justice.[^4]

Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 28 March 1737, as well as pronounced and executed on the 30^th^ thereupon in the month of March.

Let the sentence be done, \[signed\] J. de la Fontaine.

[^1]: One *dubbeltje* was the equivalent of two *stuijvers*.

[^2]: This detailed description of guns and their use by slaves is indicative of the authorities’ concern over armed slaves; see 1742 Jan Hendrik Hop.

[^3]: This refers to the region of Southeast Africa, roughly modern Maputo, where the Company had a trading post until 1731 (Shell 2001).
