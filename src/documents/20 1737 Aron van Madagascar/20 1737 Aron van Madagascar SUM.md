# ARON VAN MADAGASCAR

*In the aftermath of the arson attempts in Cape Town in 1735—6, the authorities attempted to clamp down on the number of slave runaways in the vicinity, and in particular those linked to the maroon community based at Hangklip on False Bay, led by Leander Boegis.[^1] Commandos sent out to Hangklip were unsuccessful, but a number of runaways were caught on Table Mountain and in the region of present-day Fish Hoek. Aron van Madagascar confessed to several encounters with them, including providing Leander Boegis and his group with flint-stones, and meeting up with others near Fish Hoek.[^2] He did not stay with them – he was particularly disgusted by the fact that they ate snakes[^3] – but rather roamed around the area with other runaways before he was caught. The case gives an insight into the runaways’ underworld of the Cape Peninsula in these decades, and the contacts between runaways and slaves in the town.[^4]*

[^1]: A community of runaway slaves existed at Hangklip, on the southernmost point of False Bay, throughout the eighteenth century, where they were well positioned to evade Company commandos. However, they were dependent for food on raiding wagons coming over the nearby mountain passes, or else by obtaining supplies from sympathetic slaves or by raiding nearby farms. Often they were captured during such raids. For the fullest account of the Hangklip maroons, see Ross 1983: 54-72, who mentions this case on pp. 57 and 66-7. For other cases involving them, see 1785 Spadilje van Siam; 1786 Job van Madagascar; and 1786 October van Madagascar.

[^2]: Aron’s confession is available in CJ 341, ff. 104-6. The only other documentation presented to the Council was the *eijsch* (CJ 341, ff. 100-3).

[^3]: It is not clear whether this was personal disgust or a cultural difference.

[^4]: For other cases involving such interactions, see 1735 Company slaves; 1760 Achilles van de West Cust et al.; and 1786 October van Madagascar et al.
