# JANUARIJ VAN BOEGIES ET AL.

**CJ 354** Criminele Process Stukken, 1746, Deel 2, ff. 464-67.

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, Baatjoe van Samboua, bondsman of the burgher Christiaan Victor, 40 years old at a guess, who, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, confesses it to be the whole truth:

That the slave Isack, belonging to the burgher Isack de Villiers and who was rented out to his \[Baatjoe’s\] owner, was burning charcoal for him in Hout Bay, and when the confessant collected the charcoal from there, about four weeks ago now, he agreed with Isack to flee to the land of the *Caffers*.

That when the confessant got to the Cape,[^1] he, in accordance with what was agreed with Isack, talked to the slave Damon about joining them to run away, who was willing to do so, and promised him, the confessant, to also persuade other slaves to this.

That one Sunday, after midday, the confessant proceeded to the tavern of the burgher Jan Holst, at which place he got together the aforementioned Isack, as well as the slaves: Damon of Marthinus Wessel, Thomas and Jephta, belonging to the burgher Jacobus Steijn, Jason of Hendrik Hesse, Januarij of Hans Simonsz, Januarij of Van der Schijff and Arlequijn of the honourable Cornelis Eelders. All nine of them remained in the said tavern until about 8 o’clock in the evening, which is when they, one after the other, went from there to the flagman’s house behind the kloof,[^2] which is where they had agreed to congregate again in order to set out all together to Hout Bay, which is where they progressed to that night and where they arrived at the break of day. There, as shown to them by Isack, they hid themselves in the bushes until the following evening, which is when all of them first went to the little hut in which the slave Isack kept house, from where they took a pot, a kettle and a bucket, whereupon four of the company, viz. Isack, Jephta, Damon and Thomas, went to the farm of the honourable Le Sueur,[^3] from where they took out of the workhouse a sail and a mast, as well as a rope which belonged to the boat which was kept on the beach, which they brought to the confessant and his four other mates, when they again set out to the garden, from where they also stole some mealies, watermelons, pumpkins and apples, which fruit, after all of them had placed it in the aforementioned sail, they carried to the boat on the beach, in which boat was also to be found four ropes, a grapnel[^4] with its accessories, and two small fishing nets. After this, all nine of them took the aforementioned boat to the water, got into it and took off with it from the shore in daylight. After being on the sea with good weather for four days and four nights, they went ashore at Hanglip because of a storm, which caused the boat to leak, and for which reason they remained at that place for two days.

That from there they again went out to sea on the aforementioned boat, which had been caulked as far as possible by Januarij, but, experiencing heavy weather once again, and with the boat leaking so much that they could hardly scoop it empty, they were forced to land again for the second time; without the confessant being able to say what the place is called where they left the boat behind and where they remained for a few days.

That the nine of them then proceeded along the beach with the intention to continue their journey to the land of the *Caffers* and during the morning came on top of a mountain from where they could see from afar the farm named De Uijle Craal, at which place they, driven by extreme hunger, ate the fruit of a tree there, from which they all became drunk and remained lying there like this until late in the afternoon when they again recovered their senses, at which time they deliberated with one another about going to look for food as they were very hungry. The confessant then, with this in mind, set out to the farm of the farmer Jan Swart, where he was taken prisoner and brought to prison at the Cape.

Thus confessed at the Cape of Good Hope on 10 May 1746 before their honourables Js. Möller and Am. Cloppenburg, members of the honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant and me, the secretary.

Verification

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the slave Baatjoe van Samboua, who, after this, his given confession, was read out word by word, clearly and plainly, declares to fully persist by it, therefore not desiring that anything more should be added to or taken from it, except only that the slave Isack himself took the pot, kettle and bucket from his little hut, and also that the boat had been leaking before they took off with it from the shore; and declares all of the aforegoing to be the whole truth.

Thus verified at the Cape of Good Hope on 14 May 1746 before the honourables Js. Möller and Jan Hendrik Hop, members of the aforementioned Council, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant and me, the secretary.

Which I declare, \[signed\] Jn. Fr. Tiemmendorf, secretary.

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, Januarij van Boegies, bondsman of the burgher Barend van der Schijff, 40 years old at a guess, who, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, confesses it to be true:

That fully three weeks ago now, after the confessant had fled from his owner because he could not raise his *koeli geld*,[^5] the slave Baatjoe, belonging to the burgher Christiaan Victor, came to him in one of the streets of Cape Town and talked to him about fleeing together to the land of the *Caffers*, which the confessant was willing to do. On one Sunday he went with the same, in accordance with their agreement, to the tavern of the burgher Jan Holst, where successively congregated the said Baatjoe, as well as the slaves: Thomas and Jephta, both of Jacobus Steijn, Isack, belonging to the burgher Isack de Villiers, Jason of Hendrik Hesse, Januarij of Hans Simonsz, Damon of Marthinus Wessel, and Arlequijn of the honourable Cornelis Eelders. They all remained in this tavern until about seven o’clock in the evening when, one after the other, they went from there and again got together at the house of the flagman behind the kloof, as they had agreed \[upon\], in order to go to Hout Bay, to which all nine of them proceeded that very same night and, when they arrived there, they hid in the bushes until the following evening, which is when the slaves Isack, Baatjoe, Jephta and Damon set out to the farm of the honourable Le Sueur, from where these four slaves brought with them a sail, which belonged to the boat which stood there on the beach and which they handed over to the confessant and his four mates, and then went for a second time to the aforementioned farm, from where they brought with them some mealies, pumpkins, watermelons and apples which they had stolen from the garden there, which was put into the sail and carried by all of them to the boat, in which was also to be found four ropes, a sail, a grapnel and two small fishing nets. All of them then got into this aforementioned boat with which they took off from the shore that night, and remained in it on sea for four days and five nights, landing at first at Hanglip, where they remained for two days because they had noticed that the boat was leaking and which was caulked and repaired, as far as possible, by the confessant. From there they again went out to sea but, experiencing stormy weather that very same evening and once more noticing a leak which was so heavy that the boat could hardly be kept above water, they were forced to choose the shore for the second time and to land at a place, which, as they later learned, is named Onrust, where they left the aforementioned boat on the beach and remained for a few days.

That all nine of them went along the beach, being of the intention to continue their journey to the land of the *Caffers*, and got to De Uijle Kraal where the slave Baatjoe separated from them, saying that he would go and look for food, of which they had a shortage at this time, and after having waited in vain there for about a day for aforesaid Baatjoe, they went along the beach until all eight of them were taken prisoner at the place, as they later learned, where the ship Schoonenberg got stranded, by two Europeans and two slaves, each sitting on a horse and armed with guns, from where they were first taken to Stellenbosch and then to the prison at the Cape.

Thus confessed, through interpretation from the Portuguese, at the Cape of Good Hope on 7 May 1746 before their honourables Js. Möller and Am. Cloppenburg, members from the aforementioned honourable Council of Justice, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant and me, the secretary.

Verification

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the slave Januarij van Bougies, who, after this, his given confession, was read out word by word, clearly and plainly, declares to fully persist by it, therefore not desiring that anything more should be added to or taken from it, except only that it had been the slave Thomas and not Baatjoe who had gone to the farm of the honourable Le Sueur, as also that the boat had been leaking before they took off with it from the shore.

Thus verified at the Cape of Good Hope on 10 May 1746 before the honourables Js. Möller and Am. Cloppenburg, members of the aforementioned Council, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant and me, the secretary.

Which I declare, \[signed\] Jn. Fr. Tiemmendorf, secretary.

Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, by the reverend minister, the honourable Frans le Sueur, of the following content:

That about three weeks ago now, without wanting to guess at the definite day or date, there came to the honourable testifier on his farm situated at Rondebosch one of his bondsmen, named Coridon, who was assigned as *mandoor* to his farm situated in Hout Bay, having with him a slave of the burgher Wijnand Victor, whose name is unknown to the honourable testifier, with the report that, during the morning, this slave came to Coridon and informed him that the supplies, consisting of some flour and salt, together with an iron pot and pan, given by his owner for use by him and his fellow slaves who were there burning charcoal for the same, and which were all stored in a little hut constructed against the mountain, were stolen from there during the night, and that this was no doubt done by deserters.

That upon this the aforementioned Coridon immediately went with the aforesaid slave to see if something could be discovered, and found footprints of several people going barefoot[^6] from the house down to the beach, and Coridon then also noticed that the boat, which had been standing there on two rolls lying in front of its grapnel, was gone. He then went to the workroom, the door of which was not locked but only closed by a latch, where he saw that the ropes, as well as the sail belonging to the aforementioned boat, had also been stolen, finding on further investigation that a lot of mealies were picked off and some fruit stolen from the trees in the garden, as well as that about six or seven chickens were missing.

That they both searched the whole day everywhere, both along the beach as well as on the mountains, but could not see anything of the aforementioned boat, nor discover any deserters. After receiving this report, the honourable testifier sent the said two slaves to the Cape in order to properly inform the honourable petitioner[^7] of this incident.

There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, while offering to subsequently confirm this, his report, at all times, if it may be required.

Thus related at the Cape of Good Hope on 2 May 1746 in the presence of the clerks Otto Wilhelm Rotenburg and Oloff Christoff Karnspek, as witnesses, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the testifier and me, the secretary.

Which I declare, \[signed\] Jn. Fr. Tiemmendorf, secretary.

[^1]: Meaning Cape Town.

[^2]: ‘Kloof’ probably refers to what is now known as Kloofnek. This was probably the house of the flagman on Lion’s Head, which was a meeting place of slaves and suspected runaways (see 1736 Table Valley slaves, n. 7.).

[^3]: Frans le Sueur arrived at the Cape in 1729 and worked as a minister until his early retirement because of ill health in 1744. He acquired a farm at Rondebosch but his testimony here shows that he had placed a slave *mandoor* and another slave on a second farm in Hout Bay, VOC 5910, ff. 6 and 13; DSAB IV: 308-9.

[^4]: A type of small anchor.

[^5]: On *koeli geld* and the problems faced by Cape Town slaves who were unable to get it for their owners, see 1718 Doulat van Balij, n. 5 and 1737 Januarij van Tutocorijn.

[^6]: Theoretically slaves were not allowed to wear shoes. Although there were exceptions, it seems as if in practice most slaves had to go barefoot (De Kock 1950: 49; Schoeman 2001: 534).

[^7]: This term is sometimes used in court documents to refer to the prosecutor (either the fiscal or landdrost) as the *eijsch* they drew up was in effect a petition against the defendants in a case.
