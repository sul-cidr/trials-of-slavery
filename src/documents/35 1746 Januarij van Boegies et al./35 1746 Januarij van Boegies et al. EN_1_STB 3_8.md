Right honourable Lord!

Yesterday, when I got home, the burghers Wm. Odendaal and Herms. Pietersz brought here to the prison eight slaves, viz.: Januarij van Bougies, belonging to Barend van der Schijf, Damon van Batavia of Marthinus Wesselsz, Isaac van Ternaaten of Isaac de Villiers, Januarij van Macassar of one Hans de Vlaggeman, Jason van Macassar of Hendrik Hesse, Harlequijn van Bengalen of the honourable Eelders, Jephta van Batavia of Hermanus Steijn and Thomas van Samboua of the widow Molvanger, whom I have sent to the Cape under the escort of a commando, together with this \[letter\]. The aforementioned two burghers reported to me that on Friday, the 15^th^ of this month, the first named burgher’s herdsman, who is a Hottentot, came home in the evening on his farm, situated at the Haagel Kraal, and reported to him that he had discovered some footprints on the beach, whereupon he \[the burgher\] set out there during the night, armed and on horseback, with the burgher Hermanus Pietersz, who at this time was at his \[farm\]. Both of them followed the footprints until the afternoon of the following day, when they got to the place where the ship Schoonenberg had run ashore, finding there the aforementioned eight slaves, of whom two tried to hide, yet both burghers suddenly galloped towards them and called to them: “Stand, or we’ll shoot!”, whereupon the said slaves begged them not to shoot and thus surrendered themselves willingly. In bringing these eight slaves in, these two aforenamed burghers understood from them that the boat with which they had fled was lying on the beach in the vicinity of the burgher Barend Pietersz van Weesel’s farm, and, passing by, they went to that place, finding that the boat was lying drawn up on the beach at a very small bay named Onrust, being a large flat-bottomed boat with a mast in it, of which seven or eight knees[^1] were broken as well as being cracked open on the front, which \[crack\], as they understood, the boat received behind Hanglip, which is where they first ran with the boat onto the rocks and were forced to repair it. According to the assertions of the aforesaid slaves, nine of them deserted with the boat, of which one Baatjoe van Samboua, belonging to the burgher Christiaan Victor, had left them after their arrival at Onrust.

With which I end this, commending your right honourable Lord’s beloved person and illustrious family to the only certain protection of Almighty God, and declare that I will always be with the deepest respect,

The 23^rd^ of April 1746.

Honourable Lord.[^2]
