On Saturday, 29 August in the year 1705.

\[signed\] Guilliam du Toit, Ferdinandus Appel.

In my presence, \[signed\] Jan Mahieu, secretary.

[^1]: It might be significant that Cinna ran away on a Sunday, when slaves were at least theoretically supposed to have a free day, although most farmers ignored the fact (Kolb 1777, vol. II: 306 and 309; Mentzel 1925: 124; Biewenga 1999: 203-4, 206; De Kock 1950: 61). For other examples in this volume, see 1719 Jonas van Manado; 1761 Johan Spring in â€™t Veld; and 1775 Jephta van Madagascar.
