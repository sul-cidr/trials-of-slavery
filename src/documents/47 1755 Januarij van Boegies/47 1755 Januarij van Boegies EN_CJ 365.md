# JANUARIJ VAN BOEGIES

**CJ 365** Criminele Process Stukken, Deel 2, 1755, ff. 730-31v.

Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, by Clara van Macassar, slave of the late captain lieutenant of the military, Godfried Gerhard Schindelaar, going as follows:

That today in the afternoon, the time two or half past two o’clock at a guess, when the testifier was busy dressing the youngest son of her late owner, she, because her youngest child,[^1] who was lying in the back room in a cradle, was crying loudly, at that time requested the cook of her former owner, by the name of Augustus, to rock the same. In the meantime, while he was doing this, her fellow slave, named Januarij, with whom she has a relationship, came home; who, when seeing that the said Augustus was rocking her child, asked what the aforementioned Augustus was doing at the cradle, to which she answered that he was rocking her child since it had been crying, adding that she did not know that there was anything wrong with that. The said Januarij then went mumbling and grumbling to the kitchen at the back, saying: “You have a soul, and I have a soul”. However, since, shortly thereafter, this slave came back from the kitchen and went to the front door, locked the same and took the key from the door, the testifier became frightened; for which reason she immediately, with her child on the arm, took the child of her late owner by its hand, and fled with them into the back room, besides closing the door after her. But, as she could not find the key in the door, the testifier could not lock it, because of which she at once jumped through the window into the street, but while she was busy lifting the said child of her owner through the window to her in the street, she was leaped upon by the aforementioned Januarij who, from inside the room, hit her on the outside with a *parrang* which he held in his hand, so that she instantly received a blow straight on her head, which, however, was largely thwarted by a silver hair pin in her hair, after which he dealt her another blow on the right shoulder, but without being hit deeper than through the clothes; however, as she wanted to prevent further blows with her right hand, she then also received three cuts and wounds on it. In the meantime, the aforementioned little child of her owner had run from the room, while Januarij also jumped through the window and got away by fleeing, taking with him the *parrang* and the key of the front door.

Thus related at the Cape of Good Hope on 2 November 1755 in the presence of the clerks Otto Wilhelm Rotenburg and Jochem Hendrick Borgwedel, as witnesses, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the testifier and me, the honourable sworn clerk.

Which I declare, C.L. Neethling, the honourable sworn clerk who, because of the absence of the secretary of justice, held this sitting.

Verification

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the aforementioned honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, Clara van Macassar, who, after this, her given statement, was read out word by word, clearly and plainly, declares to fully persist with it, therefore not desiring that anything more should be added or taken from it; and declares in the presence of the slave Januarij van Boegies all of the above to be the whole truth.

Thus verified at the Cape of Good Hope on 13 November 1755 before the honourables Cl. Brand and Js. Hs. Blankenberg, members of the honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant[^2] and me, the secretary.

Which I declare, \[signed\] Jn. Fr. Tiemmendorf, secretary.

**CJ 365** Criminele Process Stukken, Deel 2, 1755, ff. 727-29.

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, Januarij van Boegies, bondsman of the heirs of the late captain lieutenant of the military, Godfried Gerhard Schindelaar, 45 years old at a guess, who, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, confesses it to be true:

That coming home during the afternoon on Sunday, which was the 2^nd^ of this month November, the confessant found his fellow slave, Clara van Macassar, with whom he has a relationship and with whom he has several children, together with the cook, named Augustus, on their own in the *galderij*, of which the last named, upon sighting the confessant, walked into the back room to a cradle standing there and rocked the confessant’s child who was lying in it. Wherefore the confessant, driven by the jealousy of love, asked the said Clara, what this *jongen*, against whom he for a considerable time had conceived a certain jealousy, had to do with her, who answered to this: “Nothing at all”. The aforementioned Augustus, when hearing this, came from the back room and then fobade the confessant to speak to this *meijd*, whereupon the confessant, feeling provoked, went to the back yard with the intention to get there a piece of firewood with which to beat the said *meijd* Clara, yet, becoming senseless and mindless because of anger, he got into his hand in the slave house a *parrang*, instead of a piece of firewood, with which the confessant proceeded to the front and, after locking the front door and pulling the key from it, went to the back room in which was the aforementioned Clara, as also the aforesaid Augustus and the youngest child of his late *juffrouw*, which is when the confessant jumped after the said Clara who, together with the aforesaid Augustus, had already fled through the window to the outside of the house, and then, with the aforementioned *parrang*, gave her a cut or three, without being able to say where or whether he had hit her. And upon seeing this *meijd* bleeding, the confessant fled with the *parrang* to Table Mountain.[^3] From here, on the second night, he, with the help of the drainpipe of the back flat-roofed house,[^4] in which a Chinese lives, first climbed onto that flat roof and then into the back yard of his owner’s, in order to obtain his oilskin coat, since he was wearing nothing but a shirt. Yet, as this was not successful, the confessant again progressed to the mountain, where he remained till the day before yesterday when, forced by hunger, he went during the evening to the garden of the widow of the late former burgher councillor, *sieur* Jan de Wit, where he, after having thrown the *parrang* into the kitchen, gave himself up as prisoner to the *knecht*, who then brought him to the prison.

The confessant declares finally that he had not been of the intention to murder either the said *meijd* Clara, nor the slave Augustus, but only to beat the *meijd* Clara; as also that he does not know what happened to the key of the front door, which he had taken from it when he was besides himself and did not know what he was doing, since he had lost the key from his pocket.

Thus confessed, through interpretation from Portuguese, in the Castle of Good Hope on 12 November 1755, before the honourables Cl. Brand and Js. Hs. Blanckenberg, members of the aforementioned honourable Council of Justice, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant and me, the secretary.

Verification

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, aforementioned, Januarij van Boegies, who, after this, his given confession, had been read out word by word, clearly and plainly, declares to persist fully with it, therefore not desiring that anything more be added to or taken from it.

Thus verified at the Cape of Good Hope on 13 November 1755 before the honourables Cl. Brand and Js. Hs. Blankenberg, members of the aforementioned honourable Council of Justice, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant and me, the secretary.[^5]

Which I declare, \[signed\] Jn. Fr. Tiemmendorf, secretary.

[^1]: This was probably Roosje van de Caab, who was listed in the inventory of 1755 (MOOC 8/8, document 34½ ). She was born after a previous inventory dating from 1752 (MOOC 8/8, document 34).

[^2]: *Sic*. Clara van Macassar is not the confessant in this case, but a testifier.

[^3]: For Table Mountain as a popular hideaway for slave runaways, see 1735 Company slaves, n. 1.

[^4]: Literally ‘flat house’. The 1755 inventory describes these as ‘drie aparte huur huijsjes’ (three small separate houses for rent), MOOC 8/8, document 34½ . They were clearly hired out, one to a Chinese tenant. This detail provides rare evidence of the mixed nature of property in one of the most properous streets in the town, with a wealthy household on the outside of the block and poorer rented buildings at the rear. We are grateful to Antonia Malan for this information.

[^5]: Januarij van Boegies was found guilty on 4 December of ‘opset gepleegde moordadige quetsing’ (deliberately committed murderous wounding). Clara was examined by surgeons who declared that the wounds inflicted by Januarij on her head were potentially fatal, CJ 365, f. 732. Januarij admitted guilt and asked forgiveness, CJ 37, ff. 106-7. The death sentence by hanging was more lenient than that recommended in the *eijsch* of breaking on the cross with the *coup de grâce*, CJ 365, ff. 725v-26.
