# VARKEN, TOONTJE AND RUIJTER

**CJ 785** Sententiën, 1726-1735, ff. 333-38.

As the honourable Council of Justice of this government, from the voluntary, verified confessions of the Hottentots Varken, 17 years old at a guess, Toontje, about 22 years old and Ruijter, 20 years old at a guess, made without any torture or coercion of bonds, of irons, or even the least threat of suchlike, and from the other papers produced in court; has determined it to be evident:

That the first prisoner, Varken, during this current year, after wheat harvesting time, had set out one morning to the veld with a certain slave named Titus, belonging to the farmer Adriaen Louw, with whom he, the prisoner, usually herded a flock of sheep of the aforesaid Louw on the latter’s farm in the Jakhalsvalleij. As soon as they got there, he went from the aforementioned slave Titus to the second prisoner, Toontje, who was looking after the cattle of the aforesaid Louw in that vicinity, and requested assistance from him to take the life of the aforementioned Titus, because the same Titus continually scolds and beats him, the first prisoner.

Upon this request of the first prisoner, the second, by the name of Thoontje, immediately went with Varken to the said slave Titus who, according to what they claim, had called out to them: “Come here, I will stab you with my knife”, after which they immediately attacked and beat him with sticks in such a way that he fell down onto a patch of sandy soil; after which the first two prisoners pressed him down into the sand for so long that he suffocated miserably and died. After which atrocious deed the first prisoner went to the third prisoner, by the name of Ruijter, who was also herding a flock of sheep of the aforementioned Louw in the vicinity, and informed him of the committed murder with a request from the first prisoner and his comrade in this, the second prisoner, to lend a helping hand with the burying of the murdered slave Titus, in which the third prisoner also acquiesced. He thereupon set out directly to the place where the two first prisoners had left that murdered *jongen*, whereupon all three prisoners brought the aforenamed slave Titus to a porcupine hole and buried him in there, but only after they had first removed the clothes from Titus, which they divided amongst one another in such a way that the third prisoner, for his part, came into leather trousers, a blue shirt, a comb and some blue thread, while the first two prisoners burnt their allotted parts.

And since such an atrocious deed cannot remain unpunished in a country where law and justice are practised.

Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice of this government, serving today, having seen and deliberated with carefully considered counsel the *eijsch en conclusie* of the landdrost drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoners, apart from their voluntary confessions, properly verified, and other documents produced in court, as well as everything else which served the case and could have moved their honours; practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the free United Netherlands, and having judged all three prisoners, their honours are sentencing them herewith: to be taken to the place where criminal sentences are usually executed here and there to be handed over to the executioner, the first and second prisoners, Varken and Toontje, to be punished with the rope on the gallows in such a way that death will follow, thereupon their dead bodies to be dragged to the outer place of execution, and there once again to be hanged up, to stay thus until being consumed by the air and birds of heaven, further that the third prisoner, Ruijter, be tied to a pole, be severely scourged on the bare back by the executioner and to be branded, with sentencing to the costs and expenditure of justice, denying the *eijscher* his further demands.[^1]

Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 12 May 1735, likewise pronounced and executed on the 14^th^ thereupon.

Let the sentence be done, \[signed\] Jan de la Fontaine.

\[signed\] A. v. Kervel, Dl. v.d. Henghel, J.T. Rhenius, Ns. Heijning, H. Swellengrebel, C. Brand, Js. Möller, Mnus. Bergh, Corns. Eelders, J. Leij, P. Artoijs.

In my presence, \[signed\] Js. de Grandpreez, secretary.

[^1]: The death sentence by hanging for Varken and Toontje mitigated that of breaking alive on the cross and impaling, as recommended by the fiscal in the *eijsch*, CJ 339, ff. 154-55, and was also recorded in CJ 17, ff. 39-40.
