Statement, given in the presence of the undersigned deputised *heemraden*, the honourables Pieter Gerhard Wium and Christman Joël Ackerman, and on the requisition of the landdrost here, the honourable *koopman* Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, by and on behalf of David van de Caab, thirty years old at a guess, bondsman of the former burgher lieutenant, the *manhafte* Francois de Wet, which goes as follows: That after having been with and on the farm of the *manhafte* Johannes de Waal for about four months to suckle the youngest child of the said De Waal,[^1] the slave of the testifier’s owner, by the name of Jacomijn and with whom the testifier has a relationship, returned home on a certain Sunday, about fourteen days before the last New Year. Whenever the said Jacomijn picked up her child, who that whole day had been doing nothing but crying, and held it to her bosom, the testifier’s owner forbade it, saying in essence: “You shouldn’t think you’re with De Waal where you can sit all day long with the child on your lap”, which utterance he repeated a couple of times and when he did so again on the Tuesday thereafter, the said Jacomijn then answered him: “At *Sieur* De Waal’s I at least always had somebody to look after my child, but now there’s nobody; one day she will cry herself to death”. Whereupon the testifier’s owner became so angry over this that he took the *sjambok* for the back horses, which was hanging in the kitchen, and dealt the aforementioned Jacomijn, while she was holding the child in her arms, several blows with it, besides also dealing some blows to the child (in particular two visible wounds on its forehead) on this occasion, as a result of which the testifier’s child, who before this had been well and healthy, passed away the night of that very Tuesday, and was buried the following day. At which incident were present: the widow Jan Theron, a slave *jongen* of the said widow Theron, by the name of Goliad, a female Hottentot living at his owner’s, by the name of Anna, and a fellow slave of the testifier’s owner, named Fortuijn.

Besides which the testifier declares that, about three years ago, without wanting to determine the precise date, there had been residing at his owner’s a certain Hottentot, whose name the testifier cannot recall, who, before having served his agreed time,[^2] ran away from there, and when he was captured again after some time and brought home by the slaves of the testifier’s owner, he was suffering from a venereal disease. That the testifier’s owner then asked the said Hottentot where he had got this disease, and received as answer that it was the sister of the testifier, viz. the slave Stijn, with whom he had been having a relationship. Upon this, the testifier’s owner immediately gave the said woman slave, who was already ill, but still up and about, a thrashing with a back *sjambok* that afternoon; after which the testifier’s sister, immediately after receiving this hiding, took to bed and came to pass away that very same evening, when, after a short while, the testifier’s owner had the corpse of this slave transported from the house to an outside room and, on the following day, had her buried by the testifier, the aforementioned Fortuijn and two other fellow slaves whose names the testifier cannot recall because of the length of time.

At that time, when the testifier went on his way here in order to inform the honourable petitioner of this incident with his sister, and at the same time to complain about the harsh treatment of his said owner, the brother-in-law of his owner, named Jacobus du Toit, followed the testifier with two horses, caught up with him in the vicinity of the farm of the burgher Charl Theron, and convinced him to go and sit on one of these horses and to ride back home with him, which the testifier also did.[^3]

The testifier says that when he recollects the misfortune his family has had to endure, already twice now, as a result of the strict treatment of his owner, it is impossible for him, on account of his regret and grief, to continue serving the same, and he therefore in addition requests the honourable petitioner not to be returned again to his said owner.

There being nothing more to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, declaring it to be the whole truth.

Thus related at the office of the secretary at Stellenbosch on 10 January 1792.

This cross X was made by the testifier with his own hand.

There appears before us, the undersigned deputised *heemraden*, the honourables Johan Bernhard Hoffman and Pieter Gerhard Wium, the *Bastaard-Hottentot* Anna, 30 years old at a guess, who, on the requisition of the landdrost, the honourable *koopman* Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, declares it to be the truth:

That about three years ago, without the deponent being able to determine the exact date, when the *manhafte* Francois de Wet, at whose place the deponent had already been living twelve or more years, was going to drive to Stellenbosch with his wife, the slave of the said De Wet, named Steijn, wanted very much to go with them. And since her *juffrouw* did not want to take her with them since she was already four months pregnant, Stijn then drank vinegar mixed with gunpowder and soot from the chimney in order to abort her fetus, and, seeing that this did not meet her objective, she then, to this end, drank and ate once or twice a good quantity of brandy with lye,[^4] raisins and snake-skin. That the said slave became ill from this and, when asked by her *juffrouw* what the matter was with her, replied that she did not know. Whereupon the deponent’s *juffrouw* a couple of times gave the said Steijn medicine to use, yet this did not help at all, as, on the contrary, the same Steijn continued to vomit constantly; while Steijn, after having been weak like this for three days, started menstruating very heavily, which is when she told the deponent in essence: “I must burst now and die”, as she then did pass away that very evening and was buried the day thereafter.

That another slave of the aforementioned De Wet, by the name of Jacomijn, after having been at Vier en Twintig Rivieren at Johannes de Waal, the brother-in-law of her owner, to suckle the child of De Waal, again returned home on a certain Sunday during the recently passed month of December. Among other things, some days thereafter she went out to cut pig leaves,[^5] leaving her sick child at home, and when this work was done and she had come back, she pitifully abused this child who, during the absence of its mother, had been doing nothing but screaming, by beating it, so that even her husband, the slave David, asked her why she was beating the child so much, adding: “One day you will beat it to death”, and received as answer in essence: “It has nothing to do with you!”

The deponent’s *baas*, who upon this noise had come from the *voorhuijs* into the kitchen, gave with a back horse *sjambok* the aforementioned Jacomijn two or three lashes over the arms while she was carrying the child in her arms, whereupon the said slave hurriedly ran into the *voorhuijs* and was followed by her owner, but that the deponent’s mistress then intervened and pleaded on behalf of the same, so that she did not receive any more lashes.

That the aforementioned Jacomijn that evening went to bed in an outside room with her child, who was by then even more ill than before, and when she again got up the following morning, and also when she came into the *voorhuijs*, she did not say that her child had become any worse but, on the contrary, upon the deponent’s question about how her child was, she answered that it had slept well that night, although when this slave, after about an hour had passed, again went to the aforesaid outside room to fetch the child and bring it into the house, she found it lying dead on the bed; without the deponent having been able to discover on the body of that child anything but a small scratch on its forehead, which the deponent supposes to have been caused by the fall which this Jacomijn had with the child when she received the lashes from her said owner.

There being nothing more to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of her statement as in the text, declaring this to be the whole truth.

Thus recorded at the office of the secretary at Stellenbosch on 11 January 1792.

This mark X was put down by the *Bastaard-Hottentot* Anna with her own hand.

There appears before the undersigned deputised *heemraden*, the honourables Johan Bernhard Hoffman and Pieter Gerhard Wium, Fortuijn van Bengalen, forty years old at a guess, bondsman of the *manhafte* Francois de Wet, who, on the requisition of the landdrost here, the honourable *koopman* Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, declares it to be true:

That on a certain evening about three years ago, without being able to determine the exact date, the deponent went from his work, which he had done elsewhere on the fields that day, to the house and, when he entered the kitchen, he saw with amazement that the slave of his said owner, named Stijn, who was well and healthy when the deponent had left that morning, was lying dead there in the kitchen, without the deponent being able to say how or from what the same passed away, being only able to discover from the remains that she had shortly before been vomiting a lot. On that same evening this slave was taken, on the order of his said owner, to an outside room by the deponent, his fellow slave David and some other fellow slaves belonging to his owner, whose names the deponent is unable to recollect because of the long duration and time, and was buried in the morning of the following day.

That about fourteen days before the last New Year, when the slave Jacomijn went out to collect so-called pig leaves, she left her suckling child, who had returned home ill with her, shortly before this, from the brother-in-law of the deponent’s owner, the *manhafte* Johannes de Waal, with the other slave children in the kitchen; which child did nothing but constantly scream. That when the said Jacomijn returned, she chastised this child over this to such an extent that the aforesaid David, with whom the said Jacomijn has a relationship, addressed her with this question: “Why are you beating the child like that, you will beat it to death one day”. That when the aforesaid owner of the testifier \[*sic*\] came in upon this, he gave Jacomijn, who was carrying her child in her arms, three lashes with an ordinary *sjambok*, whereupon she ran inside to the *voorhuijs*. The day thereafter, while busy slaughtering cattle, he understood from his other fellow slaves that the child of Jacomijn was dead, without being able to say what had been the cause of her death; while the corpse was buried that same day by David and the deponent.

There being nothing more to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, declaring this to be the whole truth.

Thus recorded at the office of the secretary at Stellenbosch on 13 January 1792.

This cross X was put down by the slave Fortuijn with his own hand.

[^1]: For this practice, see 1788 David Malan Davidsz, n. 11.

[^2]: This suggests an arrangement whereby the Khoi worker was contracted for a fixed period of time. It may be that this person was in fact a *Bastaard-Hottentot,* who was indentured until the age of twenty-five after 1775 (see 1752 April van de Caab n. 1). But there was no fixed system for Khoi labourers, and possibly this was a specific arrangement for this case.

[^3]: David was setting out to complain to the landdrost. It appears from this that Jacobus du Toit did not force him to return, but rather attempted to persuade him to do so by less forceful means. It is also notable that Du Toit was De Wet’s brother-in-law. Exposure to the authorities in this way would have brought shame and dishonour, not only on the slaveowner (who was a former burgher lieutenant with the title *manhaften*, and would have had some standing in the community), but also on his relations. On honour and its operation in the Stellenbosch slave-owning community, see Dooling 1992 and 1994.

[^4]: In this case it was probably produced by mixing water and ash.

[^5]: That is, South African arum lilies, still called *varkore* or *varkblomme* in Afrikaans.
