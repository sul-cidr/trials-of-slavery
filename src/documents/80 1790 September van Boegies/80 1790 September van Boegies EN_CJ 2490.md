# SEPTEMBER VAN BOEGIES

**CJ 2490** Inkoomende Brieven, 1789-1790, Deel 6, ff. 177-78.

Honourable lord!

Having been absent from here for some days, it was reported by the burgher cornet, *manhaften* Rudolph Cloete, that one of his slaves, by the name of September van Bougies, who had deserted for one day out of fear of being beaten, caused a small wound to himself when he was taken prisoner, from which the said slave has by now already recovered fully. The said Cloete requested me that his slave, as he has never done the least mischief or had any of the least disagreement with other slaves, should not be punished, with which I could not find any difficulty in agreeing, under the express condition, though, that I, bound by duty, bring this to your honourable’s attention, and to request and await your honourable’s approval of it and, if it does not please your honourable to approve this, then that the order given by your honourable about it should be fully satisfied; as then also looking forward to your honourable’s order concerning this case, who has the honour to be with all respect,

Your honourable lord!

Your honourable lord’s obedient servant, \[signed\] H. L. Bletterman.

Stellenbosch, 22 April 1790.
