# SEPTEMBER VAN BOEGIES

*In this unusual example, a burgher requested permission from the landdrost* not *to punish one of his slaves who had run away and was soon caught, wounding himself out of fear of punishment.[^1] The letter demonstrates how the control of masters over their slaves was limited by the legal authority of the VOC, in this case not necessarily to the slave’s advantage.*

[^1]: There is no further documentation for this case, so the precise reasons for Cloete’s request are unknown. However, as head of the burgher militia he might have felt the need to be especially law-abiding in order to set an example. Moreover, if September had been found guilty of desertion, Cloete would not only have had to pay the considerable ‘costs and expenditure of justice’, but might even have lost his labour, had he been banished to Robben Island for a time.
