# RACHEL VAN DE CAAB

**CJ 363** Criminele Process Stukken, Deel 2, 1754, ff. 6-9v.

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, Raachel van de Caab, slave of the burgher Jacobus van Reenen junior, 20 to 21 years old, who on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, confesses it to be true:

That a full month ago now, without knowing the exact day or date, the confessant’s fellow slave, Joseph, who was found yesterday morning to have hanged himself, asked her if she knew where mercury was for sale, with which he said he wanted to clean buttons and mirrors; to which the confessant answered him that she did not know this, to which the said Joseph retorted: “Leave it then!”

That some days afterwards, Joseph for the second time inquired after mercury from the confessant, and also told her to ask a certain *jongen* named Jacob, who works for the apothecary of the honourable Company’s hospital, for some mercury or, if he did not have any, to talk to the slave *meijd*, named Emerentia, of the former second chief surgeon, Dirk Wijdenaar, about it. The confessant talked to the aforesaid Jacob about some mercury, without however receiving anything from him, which she first reported to the said Joseph, which is when he told her anew that she should request this from Emerentia; which she also did and later, on the day before last Christmas, she received from this *meijd* a little bottle with some mercury, which bottle the confessant handed over to the aforementioned Joseph, which is when the said Joseph requested her to tell him when her mistress asks for water, which request he also repeated several times.

That thereafter, on the Friday after New Year, being the 4^th^ of this month January, when, at about 9 o’clock in the evening, her mistress was sitting in the moonlight at the door of the house and asked for a glass of water from the confessant; she, the confessant, therefore informed the slave Joseph, who was in the back yard, of this, who then, as soon as the confessant had taken a glass from the cellar, cleaned it in the kitchen and filled it with water, poured some mercury from the aforementioned little bottle that she had given him, and added: “Just give this to the *juffrouw*, who is so false and will then not be able to look after the household”.

That the confessant handed the water to her said mistress who, while drinking it, noticed that there was something in the glass, when she asked the confessant what was in the glass, to which she then answered: “Nothing at all!” and at the same time wanted to take the said glass from her mistress, but that the latter, after having inspected it by the candle, put it aside. On account of this, the confessant went to ask the aforementioned Joseph what he had done, and when the said Joseph answered her: “*Nonje* will waste away like a skeleton”, she then became so afraid that she did not dare to make this known to her mistress.

That this very same evening her master investigated the matter carefully and asked both her and also the aforementioned Joseph: “What was in the glass with the water?”, and as the confessant, like the aforesaid Joseph, did not want to confess anything, her said owner had Joseph taken to the prison and then, on the following day, had him punished there, without, however, him confessing even then.

That later, on the following Sunday evening her said owner tied the hands and feet of the aforementioned Joseph together through the chair and spanned him into the *poolsche bok*,[^1] and let him sit in this way for fully an hour long in the expectation that this slave would come to a confession through it; yet, all in vain, as he only said that the confessant should know about it; which is why she was tied up in a similar fashion by her owner and likewise had to sit like this for fully an hour and a half, without however, out of fear and anxiety, making known anything at all of the above that night.

That on the following Monday the confessant, after she had been put upon the *poolsche bok* and had been beaten with a cane on her naked body, at last frankly confessed to her owner, the aforementioned Van Rheenen, all of the above which she knew to be true. However, since the aforementioned Friday, which was the 4^th^ of January of this year, the said Van Rheenen daily interrogated Joseph about this, yet could not get anything from him until last Thursday, which is when he expressly told Van Rheenen that he had poured the mercury into the water; though the confessant did not hear anything of his intentions or the reasons which could have moved him to it. And as this confession was done voluntarily by this *jongen* Joseph on his knees, who also at the same time begged for forgiveness, the said Van Rheenen answered him that he wanted to forgive him, but that he would however have to sell him.

The confessant finally declares that she did not know beforehand that she or Joseph had done anything wicked by it, nor that anything wicked had been intended, until after having understood from Joseph that her mistress would waste away because of it, and for this reason she was afraid to admit anything of this earlier.

Thus confessed at the Cape of Good Hope on 12 January 1754 before the honourables R.S. Alleman and H.J. Prehn, members of the honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant and me, the sworn clerk.

Which I declare, \[signed\] L.F. Haake, sworn clerk.

Verification

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the slave Raachel van de Caab, who, after this, her confession, was read out word by word, clearly and plainly, declares to fully persist by it, not desiring that anything more should be added to or taken from it, except only that the slave Joseph as well as the confessant had been tied by her owner to a chair, but were not spanning into the *poolsche bok*, declaring further all of the above to be the whole truth.

Thus verified in the Castle of Good Hope on 17 January 1754 before the honourables R.S. Alleman and P. Artoijs, members of the honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant and me, the secretary.

Which I declare, \[signed\] Jn. Fr. Tiemmendorf, secretary.

Today, 18 January 1754, there appears before me, Jan Frederick Tiemmendorf, secretary of the honourable Council of Justice of this government, in the presence of the witnesses named below, Amarentia van de Caab, slave of the former chief surgeon, Dirck Wijdenaar, of competent age, who, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, declares it to be true:

That one day before Christmas, being 24 December of last year, the slave of the burgher Jacob van Rheenen junior, named Raachel, came very early in the morning to the house of the deponent’s owner and asked her for some mercury in order to, as she said, gild buttons with; and that the deponent answered her that she would see if she could procure her some, after which Raachel went away again. However, early in the morning of the following Thursday she again came to ask for the same, and that the deponent then told her that she would see if she could get some and would deliver it to her when she came to her owner’s house to collect meat. On that very same morning she, the deponent, took a little bottle of about a finger long, in which was about half a thimble’s mercury, from the little cabinet of her owner standing in the *galderij* and in which the key was left, and hid the same on her and later, when she went to collect meat from Van Reenen, she handed it over to the slave Fortuijn, who was in front of the door, to deliver the same to the said Raachel, who was inside the house.

There being nothing more to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of her statement as in the text, being willing to subsequently confirm the same, if so required.

Thus recorded in the office of the secretary of justice of the Castle, aforementioned, in the presence of the clerks, Daniel Egbert Pfeil and Michiel Daniël Leij, as witnesses, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the deponent and me, the secretary.

Which I declare, \[signed\] Jn. Fr. Tiemmendorf, secretary.
