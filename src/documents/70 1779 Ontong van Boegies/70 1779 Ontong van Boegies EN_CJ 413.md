# ONTONG VAN BOEGIES AND ADONIS VAN DE CAAB

**CJ 413** Criminele Process Stukken, 1779, deel 2, ff. 315-19.

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates, from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the slave *jongen* Adonis van de Caab, belonging to the burgher Jan Nieuwout, of competent age, who, on the requisition of the landdrost of Stellenbosch, the honourable *onderkoopman* Olof Godlieb de Wet, declares it to be true:

That during the morning of a certain Thursday, about fourteen days ago now, without wishing to hazard a guess about the precise date, when the deponent was busy, together with his fellow slave Ontong van Boegies and the *knecht* of his said owner, by the name of Pieter Engelbregt, cutting grapes in the vineyard, the said Ontong, who was some paces away from them, asked the said Engelbregt whether he, Ontong, too should be cutting, and when Engelbregt answered to this that he should just continue with the carrying and that he, Engelbregt, would finish cutting the row, this *jongen* immediately cursed the aforementioned Engelbregt for a *moervreeter[^1] * and a child of a whore, and then asked whether Engelbregt, had anything else to order as well, while adding: “Come, try and beat me!”, whereupon the said Engelbregt took up a piece of fire wood and gave this *jongen* some blows with it; while in the meantime the deponent’s aforesaid owner called to Engelbregt: “Go on, hit him!”, which is when the aforementioned Engelbregt dealt the prisoner some more blows. Meanwhile, the said Ontong made some movements with his arm, in which he held a *boslemmer* knife,[^2] in the direction of the said Engelbregt, but the said Engelbregt dealt this *jongen* a blow on his arm with a piece of wood so that he let it drop on the ground, and when the aforementioned Ontong again wanted to pick up the knife with his other hand, he received another blow on his back and fell to the ground as a result of it.

That the deponent’s owner, who in the meantime had got there, reprimanded this *jongen* and when he said: “Old scoundrel! why do you not listen?” the said Ontong suddenly put his knife to his \[own\] throat, and said to his owner: “Come on, motherfucker! Try and beat me!”

That as the deponent’s owner returned to the house again, the said Ontong went after him for some paces with a \[carrying\] pole[^3] and a knife in his hand, but immediately returned to the said Engelbrecht and the deponent, when Engelbregt and the deponent, from fear that they might be attacked by this *jongen*, walked backwards some way, but when they noticed that this *jongen*, after having followed them for some paces, was standing still, they too stood still, which is when the said Ontong, while continually cursing and while cutting to pieces some vines with his knife, called to them: “Come here, now!”; but that, shortly thereafter, the said Ontong picked up his two baskets with grapes and took them to the cellar where the same was then also, so he was told, tied up by the burgher Arij Visagie and transported to Stellenbosch.

There being nothing more to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the certainty of his statement as in the text, and declares further, in the presence of the slave Ontong van Boegies, all of the above to be the whole truth.

Thus done and verified in the Castle of Good Hope on 29 March 1779 before the honourables Lodewijk Christoph Warneck and Christiaan George Maasdorp, members of the honourable Council of Justice, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the deponent and me, the sworn clerk.

Which I declare, \[signed\] C.L. Kloege, sworn clerk.

[^1]: This is probably a variation of the Dutch *moerneuker*, ‘motherfucker’, common at the Cape in both its Dutch and Portuguese forms (see 1761 Johan Spring in ’t Veld, n. 3).

[^2]: A *boslemmermes* is described as a ‘hunting knife’ but at the Cape this knife – which had a short, usually curved, blade – was used especially for the harvesting of grapes. From the 1790s, with the re-establishment of the Hernhutt mission at Genadendal, it was produced there and became known in Afrikaans as a *Genadendalmes* or *herneutermes* (Scholtz 1965: 158; Boshoff & Nienaber 1967: 283; Balie 1988: 61-2).

[^3]: These are called *pikolan* in both Malay and modern Indonesian and were used to carry baskets or buckets of water over the shoulders. The Afrikaans verb *piekel*, ‘to lug, carry’, originates from this (Boshoff & Nienaber 1967: 497).
