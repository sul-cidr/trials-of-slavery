# ONTONG VAN BOEGIES AND ADONIS VAN DE CAAB

**CJ 2487** Inkoomende Brieven, 1776-1780, Deel 3, f. 125.

Most honourable Lord!

Yesterday, Johannes Nieuwout, a burgher from Drakenstein, delivered into custody here his *jongen* named Ontong van Boegies, who, while he was busy in the vineyard gathering grapes and was being reprimanded by the fellow burgher, Pieter Engelbregt, who lives with the said Nieuwout, over some neglect, in a most outrageous manner attacked first the said Engelbregt and then his owner with a knife. Bound by duty, I have with this the honour to give a report of the same to your most honourable Lord; the said slave *jongen* is being transported in custody to the Cape so that I could soon conduct the necessary investigation concerning the accusation against him; while I am with due respect,

Most honourable Lord!

Your most honourable Lord’s obedient servant, \[signed\] O.G. de Wet.

Stellenbosch, 12 March 1779.

Most honourable Lord!

The slave *jongen* Adonis van de Caab, belonging to the burgher Johannes Nieuwout, came just this moment to me and informed me that he did not act in good faith concerning the statement he gave in the case against Ontong van Boegies, a fellow slave of the said Nieuwout, pending before the honourable Council of Justice, as he, out of fear for his owner, gave the statement in accordance with what his owner had instructed him; saying subsequently that the prisoner did not abuse his owner, nor did he chase after him with a knife, but that the prisoner did put the knife against his own throat and threatened his owner with cutting his own throat, while declaring further that the prisoner was unfairly beaten by the *knecht* Engelbregt with a stick; which stick he had brought along and showed me. I considered it my duty to provisionally inform your most honourable instantly, while I have summoned the aforementioned Nieuwout to me in order to shed further light on the matter; and I shall report later to your most honourable of what I shall come to discover during his appearance.

In the meantime, I have the honour to be with due respect,

Most honourable Lord!

Your most honourable’s humble and obedient servant, \[signed\] O.G. de Wet.

Most honourable Lord!

Concerning the information of the slave Adonis van de Caab, belonging to the burgher Johannes Nieuwout, viz. that in his statement given in the case of his fellow slave, Ontong van Boegies, he deviated from the truth, as I had had the honour to provisionally report to your most honourable in my previous \[letter\], I now have to report further to your most honourable that the same Adonis, having been heard today in the presence of his owner, stubbornly continues to persist with his aforesaid. Yet, after he had been urged more than once by his owner to say what had brought him to such lies, and if he did not enjoy everything from him that a slave could enjoy from his owner; he kept silent about the first, but could bring to the last nothing other than to address his owner with these words: “Why was *baas* so against me with the *meijd*?” Upon which Nieuwout told the story that the said Adonis had got involved with a so-called *Bosjesmans-Hottentot* woman residing on his farm, and that he had prevented the same Adonis from doing so because of the vice of this Hottentot woman (whom he intended to let go in order to prevent further corruption amongst his slaves). From which it then appears that because of this, this *jongen* became inflamed with vengeance against his owner, and had made use of this underhand trick to accuse his owner of having persuaded him to give a false statement. This can be further deduced from the request made to me by Adonis, viz. to be released from his owner, while adding that he would after all do no good there, and in which request he certainly imagined himself not to be denied, since – apart from some money and a double set of clothes he had supplied himself with – he had also, according to his own admission, left hidden between here and Paarl an *assegaaij*, a violin, as well as some clothes and trifles. This is abundantly proved when one considers the contradiction in the case, viz. to suppose that Nieuwout was so totally beyond himself that, in order to advance his own damage and the undeniable loss which the absence of the slave Ontong would have caused, he would have polluted himself by giving a false statement, in accordance with the deposition of the aforementioned Adonis, and doing it under oath, through which, as he himself expresses it, he would have brought innocent blood on him and his children.[^1] For which reason I then also request your most honourable, taking into consideration all of this, to please allow, in accordance with the supplication of the said Nieuwout and to prevent further damage and manifold expences, the aforementioned Adonis to be punished domestically here at the *drostdij* and to be returned to his owner. While I have the honour to be, with all respect,

Most honourable Lord!

Your most honourable’s humble and obedient servant, \[signed\] O.G. de Wet.

[^1]: An intriguing indication of the concept that the spilling of ‘innocent blood’ (including that of slaves) could bring misfortune not only to the perpetrator, but also to his descendants. It echoes Matthew 27:25, and may show how some Biblical injunctions were part of the mental world of Cape burghers.
