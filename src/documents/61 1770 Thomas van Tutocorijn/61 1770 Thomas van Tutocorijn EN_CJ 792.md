# THOMAS VAN TUTOCORIJN

**CJ 792** Sententiën, 1768-1771, ff. 154-76.

Since Thomas van Tutocorijn, slave of Adriana Debits, widow of the late farmer Andries Bester junior, forty years old at a guess, currently their honours’ prisoner, has voluntarily confessed and since, from the other documents produced in the case, it has appeared evident to the honourable Council of Justice:

That in the evening of 13 October last, the prisoner’s mistress ordered five of her slave *jongens* to set out during the following morning from her farm, named De Matjesfonteijn, situated at the Koebergen, to the farm, named De Modderfonteijn, of her mother-in-law, the widow of Andries Bester senior, in order to harvest barley there.[^1] When his mistress was already sitting and eating at the table with her children, the prisoner came to her and, up to two times, requested her to be allowed to go with the aforesaid slaves; which was repeatedly denied by his mistress, while saying in essence: “You and Gedult have to stay home to wet the clay of the threshing-floor”. That the prisoner, who was somewhat drunk, after having answered to this the final time: “Yes, my *nonje*!”, left the house and went to the slave house.

That this very evening, after his mistress had already gone to bed and had locked the room, when it was nine o’clock at a guess, the prisoner came into the kitchen on the pretext that he wanted to drink water.[^2] That the prisoner again went outside after he had drunk; however, shortly thereafter, he returned and said to the slave *jongen* Gedult, who usually sleeps in the kitchen with the slave Eva, they being the only ones in that room: “Out there the *jongens* October and Jappan are fighting! You are such an old house *jongen*, go out and separate them!”, but the aforesaid Gedult did not take notice of this at all, and concerning this told the prisoner in essence: “Let them have their way! He who is the strongest will eventually lie on top!” With this the said Gedult remained in the kitchen, as the aforementioned fight was just something that the prisoner had invented.

That the prisoner then, up to three times successively, went inside the chicken coop, which is close to the house, and not only chased out the chickens from there, and through this caused a great noise, but also caught one of these chickens; which was witnessed by the aforesaid Gedult and Eva, when Gedult asked the prisoner: “What are you doing there?”, while adding: “*Nonje* is asleep!”, to which the prisoner answered: “I want to catch the chickens!” On the further question of the aforesaid Gedult: “What do you want to do with them?”, he said in essence: “I want to eat them! You just shut up and say nothing of it!”, when he, for the third time, came to Gedult, who was standing in the door of the kitchen, and repeated to him: “There are two *jongens* fighting there, why do you, as an old house *jongen*, not go there to separate them?”

That, because the aforesaid Gedult once again did not take notice of this story, the prisoner became angry and for this reason took one of the spades standing besides the kitchen and dealt Gedult two blows. The first blow, instead of hitting his head, only hit the shoulder, and the second, the hand of this *jongen*; whereupon Gedult grabbed the spade by one end and pushed the prisoner, who was holding it by the other end, with his hand outside of the door, which is when the prisoner, with a knife he had on him, stabbed at the aforesaid Gedult, but did not hit him, since the same, when he noticed the knife, had let go of the spade, and went to the slave house where he called two of his fellow slaves to help. As soon as the prisoner noticed this, he ran away from the kitchen to the chaff-barn and also remained there until the other slaves had locked the door to the slave house from the inside and had gone to sleep, which is when the prisoner climbed through a window into the slave house, where he remained until daybreak when he again returned to the chaff-barn, which is inside the stable, and there lay himself down closely behind the crib in order to sleep, so he asserts. That in the meantime, when the prisoner’s mistress – who, since she was fast asleep, had heard nothing of deeds the prisoner had perpetrated the previous evening – got up early in the morning and found sleeping in her kitchen, in addition to the aforesaid Gedult and Eva, two of her other slaves, she asked what this meant,[^3] and upon the story being told her of what the prisoner had been up to in both the kitchen and the chicken coop, she presumed that the prisoner had run away.

That shortly thereupon, when the prisoner’s mistress, in accordance with her daily habit, which is known to the prisoner, went to the stable to look for eggs, she took with her there – even though she was used to always doing this on her own, but while she was experiencing some pain in her legs that morning – the slave *jongen* Abraham as support, in case she might need him. As the prisoner’s mistress was busy climbing onto the crib, she discovered the prisoner lying closely behind it against the wall, when she twice called the prisoner by name, yet the first time she did not receive any answer, while to the second call, to which she had added: “You’d better come here!”, the prisoner, after first groaning, said: “I have a headache!”

That when the prisoner was again ordered by his mistress, who had meanwhile retreated outside the stable in front of its door, to come to her from behind the crib, the prisoner did do so reluctantly, but stood still in the stable door and, leaning against the frame, held his hand against his head, as if he was suffering from a headache. That the prisoner’s mistress, after first saying to the prisoner: “You’d better come here!”, slowly walked from the corral to the house, but when she noticed that the prisoner was turning away at the wall of the corral, she made it known to the aforesaid Abraham through whistles and signs, since he is rather deaf, that he should also bring the prisoner to the house, as this *jongen* then also came with the prisoner to the front of the house door.

That the prisoner’s mistress, who remained standing in the door of her house, saw that the prisoner had a knife in the pocket of his frockcoat and ordered him to surrender that knife to the slave Abraham, whereupon the prisoner not only answered: “I have no knife!”, but at the same time also retreated backwards somewhat, pulled out the knife and, while waving it to and fro, said to his mistress: “There! Come here now!”, whereupon she ordered the said slave Abraham to seize the prisoner, but that this *jongen*, both because of fear and because of the swinging to and fro of the knife, was unable to do this. For which reason the prisoner’s mistress proceeded to the goose coop, which is about twenty paces from the house, from where she took a stick and threw it to the aforementioned Abraham, while saying: “There, take that stick! And hit him on the head!”

That when the prisoner, who was standing only a few paces from his mistress, heard this, he, after saying: “On the head!”, not only at the same time added to this: “I must get you!”, but also immediately made a jump towards his said mistress and tried to give her a stab with the knife he held in his hand, which stab his mistress – without knowing, as a result of the fright she got, in what manner – dodged and got into the house. The prisoner then set out running but he stood still about forty paces from the house, turned around and, once again, while hitting with the one hand on his head, showed the knife to his mistress, whereafter he put it in his pocket and likewise gave a hit with his hand on this pocket, whereafter he ran away from the farm.[^4] However, the prisoner was pursued by the farmer Jacobus Bester with some slaves, and tracked down that very same day in the dunes at Koeberg, taken prisoner and brought first to the farm of his mistress and also afterwards to that of the widow of Andries Bester senior; where that evening, when the prisoner was lying trussed in the *voorhuijs* and the slave Eva, in the presence of their fellow slave Gedult, asked him: “Who was it then that he wanted to have killed?”, he answered: “I wanted to kill my mistress!”[^5] The following day the prisoner was transported to the Cape and also delivered into the hands of justice.

Although the prisoner now pretends not to have had any intention whatsoever to kill either his mistress or anybody else, but that he had only tried to frighten the aforesaid Abraham with the knife, and also that he did not try to lure his mistress from her room with the deeds he perpetrated the previous evening; nonetheless, the prisoner, because of the murderous aggression shown to his mistress and the intended wounding of his fellow slave, cannot, under any circumstances, be left unpunished but must be punished, in accordance with the severity of the law, as an example and deterrent to other such murderous rogues.

Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, serving today, having seen and read with attention the written *crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie* drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoner by the honourable independent fiscal, *Meester* Joachim van Plettenburg, in his official capacity and, apart from this, having noted the prisoner’s voluntary confession and the other documents, properly verified, as well as everything which served the case and could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the United Netherlands, is sentencing the prisoner Thomas van Tutocorijn: to be taken to the place where criminal sentences are usually executed here, there to be handed over to the executioner, to be exposed with the rope around his neck under the gallows, further to be tied to a stake, to be severely scourged on the bare back and therafter to be branded and then to be riveted in chains, in order to labour in them without wages on the honourable Company’s public works on Robben Island for the rest of his life; with sentencing to the costs and expenditure of justice, besides denying the otherwise drawn-up *eijsch* of the honourable officer.[^6]

Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 25 January 1770, as also pronounced and executed on the 27^th^ thereupon.

Let the execution be done, \[signed\] R. Tulbagh.

[^1]: The lending or hiring of slaves to help out with the harvest on other farms was a common occurrence, especially, as in this case, between kin, Worden 1985: 25-6 and 87-8. See 1745 Cupido van Bengalen for another instance of this.

[^2]: Thomas stated that there was no water in the slave house although this may have been only an excuse for him to enter the main house. According to his testimony, Gedult was angered by his repeated entering of the house for water during the night, CJ 397, ff. 40v-41, interrogation of Thomas van Tutocorijn, articles 14 and 16. He also stated that Gedult had scornfully addressed him as ‘gij met de ketting’ (you with the chain), which suggests Gedult was taunting Thomas for being in chains, but there is no further evidence about this.

[^3]: Her words were ‘wat wil dat seggen, dat de jongens hier slaapen?’ (what does this mean, that the *jongens* are sleeping here?), CJ 397 f. 15v, testimony of Adriana Debits.

[^4]: Thomas claimed that he ran away because he was afraid (presumably of punishment) after he had threatened his owner with a knife, CJ 397, f. 53, interrogation of Thomas van Tutocorijn, article 89.

[^5]: Thomas denied this, saying that Eva’s claims ‘sijn leugens’ (are lies). Under interrogation he claimed that he had only wanted to frighten his mistress, CJ 397, f. 54, interrogation of Thomas van Tutocorijn, articles 94 and 96.

[^6]: This sentence was recorded in the *regtsrollen*, CJ 52, ff. 6-8. The court rejected the recommendation of the *eijsch* that Thomas van Tutocorijn be hanged, CJ 397, ff. 13v-14.
