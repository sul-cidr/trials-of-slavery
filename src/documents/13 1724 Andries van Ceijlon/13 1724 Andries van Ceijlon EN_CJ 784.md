As Andries van Ceilon, 53 years old, bondsman of the farmer Barend Buijs, currently their honours’ prisoner, voluntarily confessed, without any torture of bonds, of irons, or even the least threat of suchlike, and since it has appeared evident to the honourable Council of Justice of this government:

That about seven weeks ago now, the prisoner (while his master had gone from home) neither scrupled nor hesitated, up to four occasions, to go through the roof of the cellar (which, as he asserts, was open in some places) and to steal from there, on the first occasion, a small can of brandy and thereafter, on three occasions, every time a can of wine.

That when the prisoner’s master returned home again, the prisoner helped to unyoke the cattle in front of the wagon and, after having done so, put away the halters in the house.

That the said master of the prisoner, who was positively informed of the theft, forthwith tied the prisoner’s hands to his back with these halters and hoisted him up on a beam, and let him remain in that position for that morning until midday when the prisoner was tied onto a ladder by his said master, beaten with a *sjambok* for his theft, and was castigated by the other slaves with canes for the same reason.

That the prisoner, after receiving this punishment and having been untied, went to sit by the fire where, moaning over the pain he was feeling, a certain Hottentot, named Pieter, made fun of him.

That the prisoner, disgruntled over this, and also suspecting this Hottentot to be the denouncer of his theft from the cellar, tried to murder him.

That the prisoner to this end took his knife and gave this Pieter a cut on the neck, without being able to say whether he cut him twice, but that it was, however, his intention to kill this Hottentot, more so because the same was forever scolding and deriding him.

That the prisoner, after this event, took a cloth with dough from the baking chest and immediately fled, staying in a small kloof behind the house of his master.

That the prisoner stayed there for a period of ten days and sustained himself with both the stolen dough and with fruit from his master’s garden. Moreover, he did not hesitate to leave this hiding place on the night between the 6^th^ and 7^th^ of this past January and, when he saw nobody around, entered his master’s corral, which abutted the wine cellar, thereupon to strike fire in his tinder-box from which he lit a pipe of tobacco, further to light a little flue from this burning pipe and, having loosened the thatch of the cellar roof a bit, finally to set on fire, with the said flue, the cellar of his aforementioned master.

Whereupon the prisoner retreated from there to the Paarl mountain, leaving in his haste his tinder-box, fire-steel, fire-stone and tobacco bag in the corral, which were all found there the following day by his aforementioned owner.

That after this deed, the prisoner maintained himself for a number of days in Paarl, and also at Clapmuts, with food he managed to obtain from this and that person, as well as from shepherds (under the pretext that he was looking for his master’s cattle or sheep), was at last apprehended at Clapmuts by the horse and calf herders of the farmer Matthijs van den Berg, and brought to the house of his master.

That the prisoner, having been brought home (and being asked by his aforementioned owner why he had set fire to the cellar), not only confessed these crimes of his, but also gave as reason to have done this from sadness, because he had never had to endure so much punishment, and also that he sought his death and wanted to be removed from the world. After which confession the prisoner was given over into the hands of justice.

All of which are matters of the most evil, dangerous and pernicious consequences, accompanied with the intention to kill, and moreover serving to utterly ruin his owner’s possessions, had he not been informed in time of the fire in the cellar, and, accordingly, should be punished to the utmost and most severely.

Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice of this government, serving today, having seen and read the written *crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie* drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoner by the landdrost, *Sieur* Martinus Berg, by reason of his office, as well as having noted the prisoner’s own voluntary confession, properly verified in court, and the other evidence accompanying it, besides having carefully considered everything that could possibly serve the matter and could have moved \[their honours\], practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the free United Netherlands and, having judged the prisoner, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the place where criminal justice is usually executed here, there to be handed over to the executioner, first to have his right hand cut off and to be tied to a stake and half strangled to death, next to be scorched so that death will follow,[^1] thereupon his dead body to be taken to the outside place of execution and there to be placed onto a wheel, with the hand above the head, to remain thus until being consumed by the air and birds of heaven, with the costs and expenditure of justice.

Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 10 February 1724.

Pronounced and executed on the 12^th^ thereupon.

[^1]: This heavy punishment is an indication of the seriousness with which arson, with the aggravating circumstances of theft and attempted murder, was viewed by the authorities. For commentary on the meaning and significance of this form of punishment, see 1717 Aaron van Bengalen, n. 5. The *eijsch* recommended that he be burnt alive, CJ 328, f. 27. The sentence was recorded in the *regtsrollen*, CJ 8 \[1724\], ff. 1-2.
