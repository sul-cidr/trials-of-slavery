# JANUARIJ VAN BOEGIES ET AL.

**CJ 2485** Inkoomende Brieven, 1729-1759, Deel 1, ff. 130-33.

The Cape of Good Hope.

To the right honourable lord Rijk Tulbagh, nominated governor of the aforementioned Cape and the areas falling under its control etc. etc. etc.

Right honourable lord!

Taking the liberty to send herewith to the Cape a certain Bugis male slave (being, as best as I could understand from him, named Januarij, but without him being able to name his master, and who, about 3 to 4 weeks ago now, with nine other bondsmen, all Orientals and recently brought here from the \[East\] Indies, fled from their owners living at the Cape), who was delivered to me as prisoner by the farmer Andries van Dijk, with the report that during the morning of the second of this month, the said slave, together with five other bondsmen, armed with 1 bayonet, 1 axe, 1 machete, 3 knives and 5 clubs, came to the farm of his fellow farmer Fredrik Hijlon, situated across the mountain in the Kleine Rivervalley. Since they did not want to give themselves up as prisoners and even, while calling out: “Amok!”, tried to resist, three of the aforesaid slaves were shot dead, both by Van Dijk (who is living on the aforesaid farm) and by the said Hijlon and a certain young man, Martien Hendrikse; and also that a fourth slave, while fleeing, was given a blow with a stick in such a way both on his back and against his head by a bondsman of the aforementioned Van Dijk, that he too, a short while thereafter, came to pass away and, moreover, that the aforementioned slave Januarij (who, according to Van Dijk, had nothing with him, nor does he know whether he had resisted in any way) was thereupon apprehended by the said Van Dijk, and finally, that the sixth or remaining slave saved himself in the meantime by fleeing, and is still absent.

And considering that the last mentioned might possibly once again resort to his four other comrades (although the aforementioned Januarij asserts that they had separated from the others because of a disagreement which developed amongst them), and since some tracks going to and fro were apparently discovered on the beach in the vicinity of Hanglip, I have therefore already, in order to catch the fugitives, sent out two commandos, namely one from here and the other from Bot River, situated beyond the mountain, to reach each other at the large bay behind Hanglip; of which I have the honour to report with this to your right honourable lord, while further remaining with the utmost respect,

Right honourable lord!

Your right honourable lord’s most humble and obedient servant,

\[signed\] A. van Schoor.

Stellenbosch, 12 February 1751.
