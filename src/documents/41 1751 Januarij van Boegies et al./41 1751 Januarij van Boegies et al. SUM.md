These documents relate to two groups of slave runaways. The first deals with ten recently arrived Southeast Asian slaves, who separated into two groups. The first, of four, seem to have got away, while of the other six, four were killed by a commando, one got away and one was captured, hence this letter by the Stellenbosch landdrost. They escaped in the middle of January and it seems as if the encounter with the commando took place around 2 February.

News of all this reached the slaves in Cape Town, because on 13 February the second group of twelve slaves and a* bandiet[^1] *fled, inspired by the news that ‘recently a group of slaves had taken flight and had already arrived safely in a free negerij’.[^2] This group did not get very far, as they were all recaptured three days later, not far from Cape Town.

This example thus illustrates how news travelled (and was elaborated) on the slave ‘grapevine’ in Cape Town and how one episode of escape could act as an incentive for others. It is interesting that all the slaves involved were from the Indonesian archipelago: this may reveal an alternative information network that existed among Malay-speaking slaves, despite their different owners, and some of the convicts in the town.

The second group was hierarchically structured, with an appointed leader. Their plot was foiled when they were cornered by a commando, but their organisation was demonstrated by their spirited defence in what amounted to a pitched battle, with use of Southeast Asian weapons and war cries.[^3]

[^1]: The group originally consisted of thirteen, but two were shot dead during capture, so only eleven were prosecuted in the end.

[^2]: An old Dutch colonial word meaning a community, or village, of black people.

[^3]: The documentation in this case also includes the *eijsch* and the testimonies of each of the accused, as well as that of *veldcorporaal* Burgert Van Dijk junior and the burgher Willem Pool, CJ 359, ff. 118-62.
