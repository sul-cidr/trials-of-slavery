# JAN HENDRIK HOP

**1/STB 3/9** Criminele Verklaringen, 1740-1746, unpaginated.

Today, 26 November 1742, there appears before me, Arnold Schephausen, secretary of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the burgher Daniël Bokkelenberg, who, on the requisition of the landdrost, *Sieur* Pieter Lourensz, declares it to be true:

That during this current year, without knowing the actual date, while riding with the burgher Albert van Zeijl to his farm, situated down in the Lang Vallei, the deponent rode up with the same to the post of the former burgher councillor, *Sieur* Jan Hendrik Hop, situated at Piketberg, and known in common parlance as the Drogerijskloof, where at this time there was stationed nobody but the slaves of the said *Sieur* Hop.

That at that time the deponent saw in an open-standing room some rifles, as well as trap guns, with which was also a bandolier with a powder-horn and a shot-locker; while the deponent, on several previous occasions, has seen that there were also powder and bullets at that place.

The deponent also declares that, some time ago, he understood from the burgher Erasmus Smit that one Sunday, when the same was riding past the aforesaid farm of *Sieur* Hop, he had seen two *jongens* shooting with guns at a target, and that he had asked a Hottentot *meijd*, who came to him from the house, who were shooting there at a target, to which the same answered him that it was two *jongens*.

There being nothing further to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, while offering to subsequently confirm this, his deposition, at any time with solemn oaths, if it may be required.

Thus recorded at Stellenbosch in the presence of the deputy Jan Hendrik Narb and the messenger of the court Jan van Ellewe, requested hereto as witnesses of faith.

This mark X was made by Daniël Bokkelenberg with his own hand.

As witnesses, \[signed\] Jan Hendrik Narb, J. van Ellewe.

With my cognisance, \[signed\] A. Schephausen, secretary.

Today, 26 November 1742, there appears before me, Arnold Schephausen, secretary of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the burgher Nicolaas Pilletje, who, on the requisition of the landdrost, *Sieur* Pieter Lourensz, declares it to be true:

That during the previous year 1741, the deponent was riding from the farm of the burgher Abraham Mouton to his home, and when he came to the farm of the former burgher councillor, *Sieur* Jan Hendrik Hop, in the Bergvallei, he saw an ox-wagon standing there, next to which were some of *Sieur* Hop’s slaves, who were waiting there to ride into the veld to shoot game, having with them two guns and a bandolier.

That the deponent asked one of these slaves, who was the keeper of this post and named Alexander:[^1] “Where do you want to go to with this wagon”, to which the same answered: “I want to ride into the veld to shoot game”, to which the deponent replied: “You may not do that; after all, it is forbidden”, to which this slave answered the deponent most impudently: “What? I shall ride into the veld”.

That thereupon the deponent heard, while riding away, that the other slaves said to the aforementioned Alexander: “We don’t want to ride into the veld, there is that Dutchman[^2] who has seen us, and who would no doubt chase after us and would shoot us dead in the veld”, to which the aforementioned Alexander replied: “What, you will go with me, or I shall tie you onto the ladder and beat you”, but the deponent could not hear anything further about what had happened between them, as he was continuing on his way home.

The deponent finally declares as well that, on several occasions, he had seen some rifles, both on the farm of said *Sieur* Hop in the Bergvallei as well as at Piketberg, where there were stationed only slaves of the aforementioned *Sieur* Hop.

There being nothing further to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, while offering to subsequently confirm this, his deposition, at all times with solemn oaths, if it may be required.

Thus recorded at Stellenbosch, in the presence of the deputy Jan Hendrik Narb and the messenger of the court Jan van Ellewe, requested hereto as witnesses of faith.

Today, 24 December 1742, there appears before me, Arnold Schephausen, secretary of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the farmer Erasmus Smit, who, on the requisition of the landdrost, *Sieur* Pieter Lourensz, declares it to be the whole truth:

That now some time ago, without knowing exactly when, the deponent was riding from his farm, situated at Het Kruis, to that of the burgher Jacobus Gildenhuijsen, situated at Piketberg and, passing the farm of the former burgher councillor, *Sieur* Jan Hendrik Hop, at Piketberg, he saw that shots were being fired from the corner of the corral on this farm, whereupon he asked a Hottentot *meijd*, who resided with the said *Sieur* Hop and who was looking after the ewes and their lambs close by the house: “Who is shooting there?”, to which the same answered him: “Those are two *jongens*”, to which he replied: “Are those *jongens*, they are after all wearing white shirts”, and she again: “Yes! That is Galenje and Latijn, they are shooting at a target”, whereupon the deponent proceeded from there to the aforesaid Gildenhuijsen.

The deponent also declares that he is aware, and has also often seen, that the slaves who are stationed without a *knecht* on the farm of said *Sieur* Hop have rifles among them, as well as bandoliers.

There being nothing further to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, while offering to confirm this, his deposition, at all times with solemn oaths, if that may be required.

Thus recorded at Stellenbosch in the presence of the deputy Jan Hendrik Narb and the messenger of the court Jan van Ellewe, requested hereto as witnesses.
