# JAN HENDRIK HOP

*Given the Company’s fear of slave resistance in the late 1730s, and the uncertainties of the frontier districts, it is not surprising that the Stellenbosch authorities showed concern at reports that Jan Hendrik Hop had left his slaves unsupervised and with unrestricted access to guns and ammunition on his farm in the Piketberg region. Hop had a number of farm properties, doubtless as a form of investment, and did not reside on this one. Although it was not in itself unusual for burghers in the eighteenth century to own more than one farm (often including loan farms and cattle posts in the pastoral regions), the fact that there was no member of the owner’s family or* knecht *to supervise the slaves was exceptional and was noticed, undoubtedly with some concern, by the other settlers.*

*The testimonies by neighbouring farmers add interesting details, including that the slaves were planning to go and hunt in the veld, that some were fearful of being shot at by ‘Dutchmen’ but were intimidated by one of their number who threatened them with the kind of whipping that an owner usually gave, and that slaves did not usually wear white shirts. Dress, as much as gun ownership, defined status in the colony.[^1]*

*There is no record that this case was taken further, but doubtless Hop was given a warning by the landdrost.[^2]*

[^1]: There were numerous *plakkaten* strictly prohibiting slaves from carrying any fire-arms, for example *Kaapse Plakkaatboek* I: 246-47 (1688); II: 45 (art. 36-7, 1715), 120 (art. 59, 1727) and 136 (art. 7, 1728).

[^2]: There is no record of this case in the Council of Justice *regtsrollen* or criminal case documentation, CJ 24 and CJ 347. Hop was part of the burgher elite, being a burgher councillor, captain of the militia, and serving on the board of the Orphan Chamber (Hoge 1946: 173), which might explain the leniency towards him.
