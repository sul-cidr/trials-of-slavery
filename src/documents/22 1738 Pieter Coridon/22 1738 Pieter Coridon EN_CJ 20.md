# PIETER CORIDON

**CJ 20** Crimineele Regtsrolle des Casteels de Goede Hoop, 1738, ff. 1-3.

Thursday, 2 January 1738, present the honourable lord president Hendrik Swellengrebel and all the members, with the three burgher councillors, the honourables Hendrik Oostwalt Eksteen, Henning Joachim Prehn and Abraham Cloppenburg, joining in.[^1]

The *onderkoopman* *Sieur* Johannes Neder, acting as fiscal for the interim, in his official capacity as *eijsscher*,

contra:

The free blacks Pieter Coridon and Jan van Ceijlon, as also Jacob van Bengalen, bondsman of the widow Steven Viret, November van Ternaten and Roman van Batavia, slaves of the free black woman Mami,[^2] all five currently their honours’ prisoners and defendants in the case of plotting at night in their honours’ streets.

The *eijsscher* demands as in the document \[i.e. the *eijsch*\]

The defendants say that after they had been fishing, they went at six o’clock that evening to a tavern to drink a tot there since they were wet, and that when they were leaving, they were taken prisoner.

The *eijsscher* rejects the answer of the defendants as insufficient and mendacious, and persists with his *eijsch ende conclusie* as rejoinder.

The defendants request mercy as rejoinder.

The honourable Council, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the free United Netherlands, sentences all five defendants to be thoroughly whipped at the stake and then to be sent home, with sentencing to the costs; the Council denying the further *eijsch* of the Officer.

After the burgher councillors have left, at the request of the aforementioned *Sieur* Johannes Needer, thirty rolls of tobacco, which have been seized at various times, were confiscated as per custom.

In the Castle of Good Hope, the date as before.

In my presence, \[signed\] Js. de Grandpreez, secretary.

[^1]: The Council of Justice was similar in its make-up to the Council of Policy, except that in court cases (both criminal and civil) in which burghers or slaves were tried, two ‘burgher councillors’ joined the Council of Justice. These councillors were elected annually, and election conferred a great marker of status. In the 1780s the number of burgher councillors was increased to six (De Wet 1981: 180-83; Visagie 1969: 41-4).
