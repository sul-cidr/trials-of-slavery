# *Dictum ter rolle*

Honourable Lord and Lords,

On Saturday morning, the 21^st^ of the past month December, the *eijsscher* was informed by the officer on guard of the *burgerwacht*, the honourable Gijsb\[ert\] la Febre, that at eleven o’clock during the night of the 20^th^ and 21^st^ of the past month December, the corporal who was doing the rounds at the Cape had caught on their honours’ roads the prisoners and defendants in this, and, upon his \[la Febre’s\] order had taken them to prison, except for the first defendant and prisoner, who had escaped from the hands of the *burgerwacht* before the door of the prison, yet on the following day the same was once again brought into custody by the servants of justice. Which plotting and ganging together during the night on their honours’ roads certainly do not promise anything good, being all of the most evil consequences, because one cannot expect at such a time from that sort of people anything but villainy, and also since this is expressly forbidden by the general *plakkaat*, in the 82^nd^ article, the contents of which read as a warning, namely:

With this it is expressly forbidden that any of the Company’s servants – whether they are artisans’ apprentices, soldiers or sailors – as also convicts and bondsmen – whether they are slaves of the honourable Company or those of the inhabitants – should henceforth dare to be found on their honours’ streets or roads after ten o’clock at night, on pain of the following punishment: that when the aforesaid servants of the noble Company are caught doing this, they are to be taken into arrest each time and will incur a fine of two months’ wages *pro fisco* and, on top of this, without even a court case, will be whipped; if the bondsmen and convicts, irrespective of whom they belong to, are found on the street after the said time, they will be apprehended instantly and, according to the circumstances, be punished arbitrarily; from which, however, are excluded those who are crossing the streets with their masters, mistresses or the same’s children, or with wagons, or those who came from the interior or are going in that direction. Further: each and every one who wants to send his slaves out at night to do something or the other must give them a light or small lantern as a sign so that they may be allowed to pass and, in order that this be even better observed and executed, the servants of justice, the *burgerwacht* and the *ratelwacht*,[^1] and each and every one of these inhabitants, are hereby called upon to detain and bring into arrest the aforementioned servants of the honourable Company, slaves and bandits if they find them on the street after the ringing of the bell.

Whereupon the *eijsscher*, to prevent such plotting, presumes to be allowed and must conclude, viz.:

Concluding that all five the prisoners and defendants, with certain conviction by your honours, may be sentenced: to be whipped by the *caffers* and to be riveted in chains for the period of one year, and to be sent to their homes thus, with the costs; or to such an end as your honours would deem fitting.

Exhibit in court, 2 January 1738.

[^1]: The *ratelwacht* was the ‘watchmen’ and *burgherwacht* the ‘town militia’. There were two night watchmen who were under the command of the Burgher Council, and whose name stemmed from the rattles that they carried to sound alarms of fire or other dangers. The town *burgerwacht*, established in 1686, was made up of male burghers between the age of 16 and 60 who lived in and around the settlement. Each had to perform duty about once a month keeping order during the night, although this was often done through proxies, Botha 1962, vol. I: 161-63; *Kaapse Plakkaatboek* I: 220, 236-38 and 241-42, and Mentzel 1921: 66. For the *burgerwacht* in operation, see 1736 Table Valley slaves.
