# FRANS

*This incident on Marten Melkâ€™s farm at Elsenburg[^1] is revealing for the authority of the Council of Justice over privately owned slaves and their owners. An accident took place when three slave teenagers were horsing around, and Frans, the cause of it, fled.[^2] Marten Melk, his owner, reported the episode, but ten days later, when Frans had returned of his own accord, Melk requested that he be pardoned and the case dropped.*

[^1]: See 1768 Frans van Madagascar for another case on this farm.

[^2]: This is an unusual case in that slave children (or teenagers, at least) were central to it. For discussion of slave children, see 1790 Isaak de Villiers Jansz., n.1.
