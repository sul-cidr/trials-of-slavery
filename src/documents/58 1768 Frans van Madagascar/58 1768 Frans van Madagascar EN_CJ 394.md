# FRANS VAN MADAGASCAR

**CJ 394** Criminele Process Stukken, 1768, ff. 516-17v.

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the slave Frans van Madagascar, belonging to the former *heemraad*, *Monsieur* Marten Melk, 23 years old at a guess, who, on the requisition of the landdrost of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, *Meester* Jacobus Johannes le Suëur, confesses it to be true:

That fully two months ago now, on a certain morning after 8 o’clock, the confessant, working on his owner’s farm in the cellar as a cellar *jongen*, was given three glasses of wine to drink by his fellow slave, Willem, placed over him as *mandoor*, after which the confessant wanted to stop drinking, to which the aforesaid Willem, while giving him more wine, said: “Don’t worry, drink!”, so that the confessant drank even more and became drunk as a result, which is when he left the cellar and went into the bushes where he lay himself down to sleep.

That after lunch, the aforesaid Willem came to look for the confessant in the bushes, roused him and, while saying: “How drunk you are!”, beat him with a stick, after which the confessant went to the wine store, took his basket and went with it to the vineyard in order to cut grapes, which he also did.

That that very same evening, when the confessant was sitting in front of the women slaves’ house with the slave *meijden* named Silvia and Mars,[^1] the aforesaid Willem, without knowing why he did this, came and dealt the confessant, who was sitting there half asleep, a blow with the hand on his ears. Which is when the confessant got up and took a *kirrij*, which was standing behind the door of the slave house, and gave the aforesaid Willem a blow with it to his head, without knowing where this *jongen* was hit. The confessant, who was then still somewhat inebriated, did not then have any intention to beat this *jongen* to death, and also did not, to his mind, give him such a heavy blow.

That when the confessant saw the aforesaid Willem falling down to the ground, he threw away his *kirrij* and ran away, staying that night somewhere in the bushes and, after crossing the mountains the following day, was taken prisoner, after having roamed around for five days, by some Hottentots and taken to the prison in Swellendam.

Thus confessed in the Castle of Good Hope on 10 June 1768 before the honourables Tobias Christiaan Rönnekamp and Jan Frederik Willem Böttiger, members of the honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant and me, the secretary.

Which I declare, \[signed\] C.L. Neethling, secretary.

Verification

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the aforementioned Frans van Madagascar, who, after this, his given confession, was read out word by word, clearly and plainly, declares to persist by it, not desiring that anything more should be added to or taken from it, declaring all of the above to be the truth.

Thus verified in the Castle of Good Hope on 11 June 1768.

This X is the hand mark of Frans.

As delegates, \[signed\] T.C. Rönnekamp, Johs. van Sittert.

In my presence, \[signed\] C.L. Neethling, secretary.

[^1]: *Sic*. In the *sententie* her name is spelt ‘Mars’, but in the other documentation ‘Martje’. Both Silvia and Martje were from Madagascar and so would have been able to talk with Frans in their own language, giving rise to the suspicion that that they were telling him about Willem’s whereabouts. In their own testimonies (CJ 394, ff. 523-24) they both denied that they were with Frans and said that they were sleeping in the women’s quarters.
