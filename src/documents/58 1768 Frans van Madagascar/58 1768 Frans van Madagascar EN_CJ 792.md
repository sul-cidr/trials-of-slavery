# FRANS VAN MADAGASCAR

**CJ 792** Sententiën, 1768-1771, ff. 36-42.

Since, from the willing confession of Frans van Madagascar, slave of the *heemraad* Marten Melk, 23 years old at a guess, currently their honours’ prisoner, and from the other documents produced in the case, it has appeared evident to the Council of Justice:

That just after eight o’clock one morning, fully three months ago now, the prisoner, who was serving on his owner’s home farm as a cellar *jongen* under the supervision of the *mandoor* placed over him, his fellow slave Willem, got drunk because of consuming too much wine and therefore quietly went from the wine store to the bushes where he lay down to sleep.

That after lunch the aforesaid Willem found the prisoner asleep in the bushes, roused him and, while saying: “How drunk you are!”, beat him with a stick. The prisoner then went from there to the wine store and proceeded thence with a basket to the vineyard in order to cut grapes with the other slaves.

That that very same evening, when the aforementioned Willem was in the room of the women slaves, which is where his customary sleeping place is, the prisoner, who was then entirely sober and armed with a *kirrij*, which he held hidden under his waistcoat, not only, for fully half an hour, walked up and down in front of the door of this room, but afterwards also sat down between the doors of the men’s and women’s rooms and kept his eyes steadily fixed on the door of the women slaves’ room. This caused the slave *jongen* Parfors, who knew of what had happened between the prisoner and the aforesaid Willem in the bushes, to presume that the prisoner was watching for the aforementioned Willem with the intention to hit him with the *kirrij*. For which reason the said Parfors told his fellow slave Achilles to go to the women slaves’ room and to inform the aforesaid Willem of this, who indeed did so; when the aforementioned Willem came out of the room to the prisoner and asked him: “Frans, do you want to hit me?”, to which he was answered by the prisoner: “Who says that?” The said Willem then continued: “I know that you want to hit me!” and at the same time turned around, just as if he wanted to return again to the aforementioned room, which is when the prisoner dealt the aforementioned Willem a blow on his head with the *kirrij* and with that caused a wound which penetrated through the three tables[^1] to the temporal bone, as a result of which the aforementioned Willem suddenly fell down to the earth and shortly thereupon died. The prisoner, who meanwhile had set out in flight, was taken prisoner in the Swellendam district after roaming around for some days, and was transported from there to here and thus came into the hands of justice.

But since the perpetration of this manslaughter can under no circumstances be left unpunished in a country where people properly uphold law and justice, but ought to be punished in an exemplary fashion as an example and deterrent to others.

Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, serving today, having read and considered with attention the written *crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie* drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoner by the landdrost of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, *Meester* Jacobus Johannes le Suëur, by reason of his office; further, having noted the same’s voluntarily verified confession, as well as everything else which served the case and could possibly have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the United Netherlands, having judged the prisoner Frans van Madagascar, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the place where criminal sentences are usually executed here, and, having been handed over to the executioner, to be punished with the rope on the gallows in such a way that death will follow, further the same’s dead body be dragged to the outside place of execution and there once again to be hanged on the gallows, to remain thus until being consumed by the air and the birds of heaven, with sentencing to the costs and expenditure of justice.[^2]

Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 30 June 1768, as also pronounced and executed on the 2^nd^ of the thereupon following month July.

Let the sentence be done, \[signed\] R. Tulbagh.

[^2]: This was the sentence recommended in the *eijsch*, CJ 394, f. 515. Frans was found guilty of manslaughter, and said in his defence that ‘den slaaf Willem soo hard niet geslagen te hebben, dat hij naar sijne gedagten, daarvan gestorven sijn soude’ (he had not hit the slave Willem so hard that, in his opinion, he would have died as a result), CJ 50, ff. 46-8. Apart from the documents printed here, the documentation for this case includes the testimonies of Perfors van de Caab, Achilles van Madagascar, Silvia van Madagascar and Martje van Madagascar, CJ 394, f. 518-24.
