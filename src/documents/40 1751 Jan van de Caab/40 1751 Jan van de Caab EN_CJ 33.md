# JAN VAN DE CAAB

**CJ 33** Crimineele Regtsrolle des Casteels de Goede Hoop, 1751, ff. 31-3.

Thursday, 18 February 1751, in the morning, present the honourable lord president Rijk Tulbagh, nominated governor of this place, and all the members, except for the honourable Willem van Kerckhoff, through indisposition, with the burgher councillors joining in.

The honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, in his official capacity, as *eijscher*,

contra:

Jan van de Caab, currently their honours’ prisoner and defendant in this case, because he did not scruple to brazenly leave his master, the farmer Hendrick Ecksteen, and, during the month of May of the past year 1750, to flee on the ship the Hof d’ Uno from here to the fatherland,[^1] where he remained until he recently arrived here again as a sailor, under the name of Jan Harmensz Grutter of St. Helena, on the ship Middelburg, whereupon he was delivered into the hands of justice.[^2]

The honourable *eijscher*, having delivered his action orally, to the purport of what is mentioned in the presentation \[i.e. *eijsch*\], demands that, with certain judgment by your right honourable lord and the honourable members, the defendant in this should be severely whipped by the *caffers*, further to be riveted in chains for a period of two successive years, to return thus to his owner, provided he pays the costs.

The defendant gives as answer that he had come to the Cape with the wagon of his master, that he remained behind here, and moreover that he had got aboard ship with an English boat and could not return again to shore, and thus got to the fatherland and to Zeeland, where he had married a woman with children; further requesting pardon.

The honourable *eijscher*, refusing the defendant’s claim, persists with his *eijsch en conclusie* as rejoinder.

The defendant persists with his given answer as rejoinder.

The parties renounce producing any further evidence.

The Council, after considering the matter, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the United Netherlands, as well as his most serene highness the Lord Prince of Orange and Nassou, as hereditary Stadholder of the Republic, our chief Governor, Captain and Admiral General, concurs with the *eijsch* of the honourable *eijscher* and sentences the defendant to the costs.

In the Castle of Good Hope, the date as above.

In my presence, \[signed\] Jn. Fr. Tiemmendorf, secretary.

[^1]: Hof d’ Uno was a ship of the Chamber of Zeeland which visited Cape Town, on its way back from Batavia, between 26 April and 12 May 1750. Four sailors were recruited during this period, of which Jan was one, Bruijn et al. 1979, vol. III: 394-95.

[^2]: Jan van de Caab enrolled as Jan Harmensz Grutter van St. Helena (interestingly taking the toponym of a place where his colour would arouse no suspicion and which supplied men for shipping crews throughout the southern Atlantic world), and sailed back to the Cape on the ship Middelburg, also owned by the Chamber of Zeeland, which left on 18 October 1750, called at Santiago (on the Canary Islands) and arrived in Cape Town on 10 July 1751, Bruijn et al. 1979, vol. II: 530-31. The statement indicates that he had married a woman in Zeeland who had children, but this seems to have done nothing to improve his financial condition. He was employed at a monthly wage of 8 guilders, the standard wage for a sailor, and his wage book was debited with the costs of provision of two linen *pakken* (a standard form of shirt and trousers, Schoeman 2004: 72-6) at 6 guilders, 4 shirts at 8 guilders and 8 *schellingen*, and shoes at 2 guilders, VOC 13047, f. 154. The provision of clothes as part of an advance was necessary for many of the impoverished new recruits to the VOC.
