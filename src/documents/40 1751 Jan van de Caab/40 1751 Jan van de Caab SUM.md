# JAN VAN DE CAAB

*This and the case 1752 Jacob van de Caab both concern Cape-born slaves who escaped to Europe on board ships in Table Bay, and who were only captured when they returned to the colony in the employ of the Company. There is no evidence that the two were connected, and they took place a year apart, but the second may well have been inspired by the first since such ‘disappearance acts’ would certainly have spread around the Cape Town slave grapevine.*

*They provide intriguing examples of innovative methods used by slaves to escape. Their mistake was to enrol in the Company as sailors once they had reached the Netherlands, presumably in the hope that they would be sent to the East Indies and not be caught at the Cape.[^1]*

[^1]: This also indicates the poverty they would have encountered in the Netherlands without kin or resources of their own: employment by the Company was probably their only alternative. By the mid-eighteenth century, the VOC was short of a ready supply of sailors and was not discriminating about whom it took on. It also employed a number of Asians in this capacity, although usually they were contracted in Asia (Bruijn et al. 1987, vol. I: 151-52). For this and other examples of slaves escaping on board ships, see Ross 1983: 73-80.
