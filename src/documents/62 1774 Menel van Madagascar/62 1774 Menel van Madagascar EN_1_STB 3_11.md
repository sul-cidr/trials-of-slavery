# MENEL VAN MADAGASCAR

**1/STB 3/11** Criminele Verklaringen, 1759-1782, unpaginated.

Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Martinus Adrianus Bergh, by the slave Julij van Bengalen, of competent age, bondsman of the burgher Christoffel Lombard, which is of the following content, namely:

That some days ago now, during the evening, when the testifier, together with his fellow slaves Cupido van Bengalen and Menel van Madagascar, was in the slave house on his ownerâ€™s farm situated at Riebeek-Kasteel, he lay down to rest while the aforementioned Cupido and Menel, as they are accustomed to doing, went to lie down at the fireplace there, without the testifier, since he was tired from working and fell asleep immediately, seeing or hearing anything of them that evening.

That when the testifier got up in the morning and found the aforesaid Cupido still lying in bed, he asked him what was wrong with him, why was he not getting up and if he was ill. He received as an answer from the same that on the previous evening, the aforementioned Menel fell out with him over their sleeping places by the fire and that he, Menel, had hit Cupido with a spade on his head; which Cupido then also came to die seven days after this.

There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing to subsequently confirm the above, if so required.

Thus related at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch on 2 July 1774 in the presence of the beadle Johannes Jacobus Reijniersz and the burgher Johannes Engel, requested as witnesses hereto.

This mark X was set down by the slave July with his own hand.

As witnesses, \[signed\] J.J. Reijniers, J. Engel.

With my cognisance, \[signed\] A. Faure, secretary.
