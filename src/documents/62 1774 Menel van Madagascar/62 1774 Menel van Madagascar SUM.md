A mid-winter fight between slaves over who would sleep by the fire gives a brief insight into living conditions on this farm at Riebeek-Kasteel. Unusually, the farm had a separate ‘slave house’.[^1] The case was considered serious enough to be sent to the Council of Justice and Menel was given a life sentence on Robben Island.[^2]

[^1]: Most Cape farms did not have a slave labour force large enough to warrant separate slave living quarters of the kind found in Atlantic plantation slave societies, but there were, as in this case, exceptions (see 1768 Frans van Madagascar for unusually extensive slave quarters). See 1745 Cupido van Bengalen, n. 1 for a discussion.

[^2]: Menel’s case was first heard by the Council of Justice on 21 July 1774, but was held over until 18 August when Menel (then referred to as Menel van Mosambicque) was sentenced to be publicly whipped and branded, and sent to labour for life on the public works on Robben Island, CJ 56, ff. 39-40 and 46-7. This was the sentence recommended by the *eijsch,* CJ 407, f. 428 \[modern pagination\]. The testimonies of Menel and of Julij van Bengalen are in CJ 407, ff. 431-38 \[modern pagination\].
