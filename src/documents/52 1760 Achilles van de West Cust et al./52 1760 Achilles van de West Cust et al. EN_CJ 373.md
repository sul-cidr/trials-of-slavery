Answer: Over the conspiracy with the gang of murderers and the giving of food, I admit to be punishable, but as to the enticement of my fellow slaves I have no guilt, and because I knew it was wrong, I did not wish to go along to the land of the *Caffers*; however, of the plundering of farms and the murdering of people I know nothing, but I did hear from the other slaves that they wanted to take gunpowder from their farm, but I did not agree to this.

Thus interrogated and answered in the Bugis language by Pieter Matthijs Pieterssoon in the Castle of Good Hope on 9 August 1760, before the honourables P. Hacker and Jn. Haszingh, members of the honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, who have properly signed this, together with the interrogatee, as also the aforementioned interpreter P.M. Pietersoon and me, the secretary.

Which I declare, \[signed\] C.L. Neethling, secretary.

Verification

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the slave September van Boegies, who, after this, his aforegoing interrogation, with the responses he had given to it, had been read out word by word, clearly and plainly, declares to fully persist by it, not desiring that anything more be added to or taken from it, except only: that he intended to run away as well; that he had asked gunpowder from the cook, without, however, having threatened him; that Baatjoe of Smid had slept on the oven; that the confessant admits to be guilty of enticing of his fellow slaves and, finally, that the plundering of farms and the murdering of people had not been decided upon definitely, and declares all of the above to be the truth .[^3]

Thus verified in the Malay language and interpreted as before, in the Castle of Good Hope on 12 August 1760.

This X is the mark of September van Boegies.

For the interpretation, \[signed\] P.M. Pietersoon.

As delegates, \[signed\] P. Hacker, Jn. Haszingh.

In my presence, \[signed\] C.L. Neethling, secretary.

[^1]: On the use of the respectful term *maaij*, see 1755 Patientie van Manacabo, n. 7.

[^2]: Meaning the other slaves attached to that house or farm, an interesting insight into the ways in which a slave identified with the other slaves of his owner’s household.

[^3]: It is not clear why September van Boegies here retracted everything that he so vigorously denied during the interrogation. It may have been because of the other slaves’ testimonies, or possibly the threat of torture, although the records are not usually silent on the latter.
