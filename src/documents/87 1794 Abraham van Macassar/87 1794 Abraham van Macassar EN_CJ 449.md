# ABRAHAM VAN MACASSAR

**CJ 449** Criminele Process Stukken, 1792-1794, ff. 419-21.

Statement, given in the presence of the undersigned deputised *heemraden*, the honourables Pieter Gerard Wium and Christman Joël Ackerman, on the requisition of the landdrost here, the honourable Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, by the burgher Dirk Hoffman, of competent age, which goes as follows:

That the testifier, who lives with his father, the lieutenant of the burgher militia, Matthiam Hoffman, \[witnessed the following:\][^1] last night, the time being about half past eight, the bondsman of his father, by the name of Abraham, came home, having worked that day at the deacon, *Sieur* Jacobus Roux,[^2] and was asked by his father why he, Abraham, could not say “Good evening” when he got home, who in essence answered him: “If I do my work during the day and come home in the evening, that is enough”, upon which his father dealt the aforementioned Abraham some blows with his fist. The aforesaid Abraham asked his father: “Why do you hit me?”, and then repaired to the slave house, but returned almost at once to the kitchen. When the said Abraham was asked by the father of the testifier: “What are you doing here?”, and was answered by the aforementioned Abraham: “I want fire!”,[^3] who then again repeated his question to the father of the testifier: “Why did you hit me?” Hereupon his father gave the aforesaid Abraham some strokes with a cane of quince, during which the aforesaid Abraham repeatedly said to the father of the testifier: “Stop it, Stop it”. The testifier’s brother, by the name of Jesais[^4], noticing that the aforementioned Abraham had hidden a knife between his jacket and shirt, grabbed Abraham with his left hand and, with his right hand, tried to get possession of the knife. The aforesaid Abraham pulled himself loose, while the testifier closed the inside door of the kitchen, then loaded his pistol, while his father provided himself with a sabre and his brother loaded his musket.

That since the testifier, as also his parents and brother, did not hear anything, they went to bed, but they were awoken at about 11 o’clock by a noise as if the house was on fire and, when getting up, noticed that the house was on fire; whereupon the testifier ran to the outside as far as the trees standing before the house. The aforementioned Abraham, so it seemed to the testifier, came running from the slave house up to him with a knife in his hand and, as soon as the testifier had recognised Abraham, he asked him: “Why do you want to stab me?”, to which the aforesaid Abraham said: “I will show you that!” and thereupon stabbed the testifier in his left arm; whereupon the testifier, feeling himself wounded, proceeded in all haste to the house of the former *heemraad*, the honourable Christman Joël Ackerman.

There being nothing more to relate, the testifier declares to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing to confirm the same with oaths.

Thus related at the residence Welgevallen, situated across the Eerste River at Stellenbosch, on 24 January 1794, in the presence of the deputised *heemraden* mentioned in the heading, who have signed the original of this, together with the testifier and me, the secretary.

Which I declare, \[signed\] J. Wege, secretary.

[^1]: The original contains no main verb of which ‘the testifier’ could be the subject, but presumably something like that supplied is meant.

[^2]: Abraham was a bricklayer or mason, according to the testimony of Matthiam Hoffman, and had presumably been lent or hired out for the day. Hoffman also added the detail that he came back to his owner’s farm, but had failed to report his presence to his owner, CJ 449, f. 405. For slave hiring, see 1776 Julij van Timor, n. 2.

[^3]: For his tobacco pipe, according to the testimony of Matthiam Hofman, CJ 449, f. 406.

[^4]: *Sic*. The brother’s name was Josias.
