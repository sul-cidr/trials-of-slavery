There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, Anna Dorothea Otto, wife of the burgher Jurgen Radijn, who, on the requisition of the landdrost of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, the honourable Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, declares it to be true:

That at about 10 o’clock on a certain night at the beginning of the month of June, without being able to determine the precise day, the deponent heard a loud noise caused by the barking of the dogs; when she got up from her bed and went to the room of the *meijden* in order to find out what the cause of this was, and then called to these *meijden* until her old slave Rachel woke up and asked her what she desired. The deponent then ordered her to light a candle and, when this was done, she discovered in the light that the burgher David Malan Davidsz had entered that room and was in his stockings under the bed of one of her women slaves. That the deponent asked Malan about the reason for his presence there, who answered her in essence: “Mother Radijn, I did not come here for your *meijden*, but on account of some business matters”. The deponent then asked Malan: “What business matters?”, yet he did not say anything to this, but immediately replied: “Goodnight, Mother Radijn”, and departed from there by foot.

That when the deponent, on the 12^th^ of this month, got up, there came to her the wife of aforementioned Malan, who was very sad and sorrowful, and who told her in a plaintive manner that her husband, the said Malan, had absented himself that night with two horses and also took with him two pillows, a rifle, gunpowder and shot, as well as a new pair of trousers; to which the deponent also adds the circumstances of the departure of the abovementioned Malan, as narrated to her by his wife in this manner, viz. that she, on the aforesaid morning, because her husband had not yet appeared, knocked on the door of his bedroom, but when she did not receive any answer from him, she opened the door herself and discovered that he had gone from there.

That shortly thereupon, on that same morning, the deponent sent a Hottentot to the keeper of the kloof,[^1] Jan de Vos, to whom she had loaned her slave Sara as wet nurse,[^2] in order to enquire whether the slave Sara did not perhaps absent herself, since she feared that the same might have eloped with the aforesaid Malan, seeing that there were already rumours that Malan had a relationship with the said slave Sara since, when the deponent reprimanded her now and then, she said that Malan had fathered her child. She then received as answer from the aforementioned keeper of the kloof that the said *meijd* had gone from there that night.

The deponent declares to have gathered from the wife of the aforementioned De Vos that the said slave had once or twice threatened to dress herself in men’s clothing so that she could run away.

There being nothing further to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of her statement as in the text, being willing to subsequently confirm the same with solemn oaths, if so required.

Thus recorded on the farm named De Harmonie in Hottentots Holland on 18 August 1788.

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the keeper of Hottentots Hollands kloof, Jan de Vos of Severen who, on the requisition of the landdrost of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, the honourable Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, declares it to be true and truthful:

That some time ago, about fourteen days at a guess, Dorothea Otto, the wife of the burgher Jurgen Radijn, told the deponent that on a certain night, when she went out of her room because of the barking of the dogs, and got to the kitchen, she saw a certain person going to the outside and afterwards two coming back to the inside, which made her suspicious. She then went there with a lit candle and found that the burgher cornet David Malan Davidsz was under the bed of one of her slave *meijden*, without her mentioning the name of this *meijd* to the deponent.

That the deponent was further informed by the wife of the aforesaid Malan that she had wanted to be separated from him because he treated her very badly, since, as the deponent, in accordance with general rumour, suspected, the said Malan had a relationship with a certain woman slave Sara, belonging to *Juffrouw* Radijn. On the occasion when the aforesaid Malan, about fourteen days ago now, came to the deponent, asking to buy some cattle for his auction and the deponent agreeing to this,[^3] the deponent directed the conversation to Malan’s conduct concerning the relationship he had with the slave Sara, and at that time advised him that he really ought to change his way of life. Malan then told him that he would change his conduct and that he and his wife had agreed to separate after the forthcoming auction[^4] and that his wife would get three parts of the estate and that he would take the remaining part.

The deponent also declares that with his departure, the aforementioned Malan asked him if he might not say something to the *meijd* Sara in private, to which the deponent answered that he should ask the deponent’s wife, however the said Malan did not do this and thereupon departed from there.

That moreover, a few days ago now, the deponent learned from one of his slaves by the name of Damon that a certain European was hanging around in the vicinity of his farm, and afterwards came up to the garden, without, however, the deponent having discovered anything about this man.

Finally, the deponent declares that the said slave Sara, who was given to him as wet nurse by the aforementioned *Juffrouw* Radijn, got dressed and washed herself more than usual on the afternoon of last Monday, the 11^th^ of this month, and that night, between 11 and 12 o’clock, asked his wife to \[be allowed to\] go outside, which was also granted by the deponent’s wife, and that the said Sara then indeed went outside and shortly thereupon returned again, yet shortly thereafter she again requested to go out of the house once more, which she then also did. Yet, when the said slave did not return after a long time, the deponent went outside the house with his musket and dogs and searched for the same Sara around his farm, but he did not find anything.

On the morning thereafter, the deponent again searched everywhere for the said Sara because the aforementioned *Juffrouw* Radijn had ordered him that the said Sara should not, under any circumstances, be allowed to go outside of the house on her own, and that he did not want to ask after the reasons for this, since he knew them well.

Also, that same morning *Juffrouw* Radijn had the deponent asked by a Hottentot if the slave Sara was still with him since the aforementioned Malan was gone.

There being nothing further to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing to subsequently confirm the same with solemn oaths, if so required.

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the burgher Isaak de Vlaming who, on the requisition of the landdrost of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, the honourable Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, declares it to be true and truthful:

That on Tuesday morning, the 12^th^ of this month August, there came with tearful eyes to the deponent, the wife of the burgher cornet David Malan Davidsz, who informed him in a plaintive manner that when her aforesaid husband did not get up that morning, at first she and then her son knocked on his door, but not receiving any answer, she then went outside the house and pulled opened one of this room’s windows, and then let somebody climb into the room, which is when she discovered that her husband was gone and had taken with him a bolster, two pillows and some clothes, besides his rifle, gunpowder and shot; discovering afterwards also that he had got two straps from the slave house and had taken with him two riding-horses. The said wife of Malan then requested the deponent to go on her behalf to Stellenbosch in order to inform the honourable landdrost Bletterman, the petitioner in this, of what had happened and to ask what she should do about this \[lit. how she should behave herself regarding this\], since the forthcoming auction was at hand and she did not know if the posters ought not now to be torn off. For this reason the deponent then went to the honourable petitioner and, after his honour was accordingly informed about everything by him; the petitioner asked the deponent if he had power of attorney, because, as the placards had been put up by the \[*illegible*\] they must also be taken down by him, and that the petitioner then told the deponent: “Even if you had power of attorney, the matter is of too great an importance, the woman must come herself”,[^5] after which the petitioner again continued: “But De Vlaming, what do you think of this?”, to which the deponent replied: “God knows, trouble may come of it, the *meijd* is also gone and she has left her child in the lurch”.

There being nothing further to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing to subsequently confirm the same with solemn oaths, if so required.

[^1]: On his function, see 1786 Augustus van de Caab et al., n. 12.

[^2]: Lactating slave women were often used as wet nurses, either to their owner’s children or hired out to other families, as in this case (Shell 1994: 304-12). Sara had given birth to Malan’s child, although whether this was the cause of her present lactation is not clear. See also, on this issue, 1792 Francois de Wet.

[^3]: The text here is corrupt: the phrase ‘voor zijn \[*onleesbaar*\]’ should probably have been crossed out, i.e. it was replaced by ‘voor zijn vendutie’, or vice versa.

[^4]: Malan’s marriage was clearly on the rocks by this stage, and the forthcoming auctioning of their goods may have been because of their impending separation – and have given Malan an incentive to elope with Sara.

[^5]: The text is corrupt here, with the result that the meaning of this whole sentence is rather opaque.
