Since, during the night of the 11^th^ and 12^th^ of August of the recently passed year 1788, the cornet of the Stellenbosch burgher cavalry, David Malan Davidsz, supplied with a rifle, gunpowder and shot, as well as some clothes, quietly departed from his farm Vergelegen and proceeded to the residence of the keeper of Hottentots Holland kloof, by the name of Jan de Vos, where at this time was to be found the slave Sara, belonging to the burgher Jurgen Radijn (and with which slave the said Malan, according to undeniable proof of this, had already previously been living in adultery).

And he, Malan, took flight with this same slave Sara (the latter abandoning her suckling child), without, though, leaving even the least instruction about his business affairs, notwithstanding that a voluntary sale for the 18^th^ of the same month August on his aforesaid farm Vergelegen had already been advertised by the setting up of placards.

Therefore, the landdrost of the Stellenbosch and Drakenstein districts, the honourable *koopman* Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, on the complaint concerning this brought to him by the wife of the same Malan, properly informed the honourable Council of Justice of this government and reported further:

That the said Malan, with the aforesaid woman slave Sara, had passed the farm of the *veldcorporaal* Petrus Stephanus du Toit at the Riviersonderend on the 14^th^ of the month August, that they arrived on the 15^th^ thereupon at the *veldwagtmeester* Daniel du Toit at Goudini and, calling himself Jan Nortjé, requested help for him and his wife (denoting the aforementioned woman slave Sara)[^1] to cross the Breede River with the boat; while Malan also pretended to be Jan Nortjé at, among other places, the Hex River kloof to one Abraham Finnerhold, and was seen successively on his further journey into the interior with this same slave, and was also sighted, among other places, on the farm of the widow of Karel van der Merwe.

For which reason the said landdrost, armed with the necessary evidence in the aforesaid case, undertook the proper procedures against the same Malan: on the 4^th^ of September of the said year 1788, he requested and obtained a mandate whereby the said fugitive cornet David Malan was summoned under the ringing and beating of bells to come to clear and justify himself in this case, on pain that, failing this, procedures would be taken against him in accordance with the law (which writ of summons was repeatedly published and set up everywhere in four week terms, without, however, the said Malan coming to the fore, even though, as one was informed for certain, he obtained knowledge through a messenger of the writ of summons issued against him). Consequently, the aforementioned landdrost, on 27 November of the said year, requested a fourth mandate by decree in superabundance to serve as arraignment.[^2] That since the aforesaid Malan did once again not appear on this last summons, which was after all being issued for a term of six weeks, but on the contrary remained fugitive and hidden, he, apart from having disdained justice to the utmost, had thereby, in accordance with the law, not only confessed the crimes laid against him, but is also taken to be convinced and persuaded of them. Therefore, on 8 January of this year, the said landdrost delivered his action, with the other documents relating to it, and, after having argued the case, concluded as by rights.

And since such outrageous crimes cannot remain unpunished in a country where justice is upheld.

Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice of this government, serving today, having seen and read with attention the written declaration of intent of the landdrost of the Stellenbosch and Drakenstein districts, the *koopman* Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, and the *conclusie* delivered against the aforementioned David Malan Davidsz, further having noted the documents produced with it and the contumacy of the defaulter, and similarly everything that merits reflection and could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the United Netherlands, demotes the defaulter and fugitive David Malan Davidsz from his rank as cornet of the Stellenbosch burgher cavalry, and besides this banishes him from this government and everything which resorts under it, as their honours are banishing him with this, on pain that, if he ever comes into the hands of justice, he is then to be punished according to merit, with sentencing the defendant to all the costs that were incurred in this case.[^3]

Thus done and sentenced at the Cape of Good Hope on 5 March 1789, as also pronounced in the Castle of Good Hope on the 28^th^ thereupon.

[^1]: There was clearly no difficulty about Sara being passed off as Malan’s wife, which suggests that colour was not a reliable indicator of free status.

[^2]: Under Cape criminal procedure, an accused person who could not be found was summonsed to appear before the court up to four times ‘by means of placards and the ringing of a bell’. Failure to do so, as in this case, resulted in permanent banishment (Botha 1962, vol. II: 130). See also 1707 Jan de Thuilot, n. 6.

[^3]: The sentence was recorded in CJ 71, ff. 81-2. Control of the estate (which was in considerable disorder) was taken over by the Council of Policy (CJ 71, ff. 82-90), although Elizabeth Malan requested that the sentence be overturned and she be given administration of the estate (Leibbrandt 1906: 814-15, 19 October 1789). A fine of 1000 rixdollars was extracted from the estate on 18 November, CJ 71, ff. 392-96.
