Since Caesar van Madagascar, bondsman of the burgher Daniel Malan, 30 years old at a guess, currently their honours’ prisoner, has voluntarily confessed, and since, from the documents furnished in the case, it has appeared evident to the honourable Council of Justice:

That on Friday, the 14^th^ of the month June of this current year, at about half past eight in the evening, the prisoner’s owner went to the kitchen on his farm, situated behind Groenberg, and found there the prisoner, together with two of his fellow slaves by the names of Adam and Pedro, whom he asked, in essence, why they had not gone to bed, as they would have to get up again early in the morning to help plough the fields.

That the prisoner, who according to the testimony of his owner has already on several occasions employed outrageous and improper expressions with regard to him, answered him in an impudent way, and indeed, according to the prisoner’s own confession, with these words: “I am going to make my bed just now, there is enough time, I will inspan the cattle early tomorrow”. The prisoner’s owner hereupon ordered the prisoner to be silent; without this order, however, making even the least impression upon the prisoner, since the prisoner, instead of obeying this, continued on the contrary in an insolent fashion: “I was awake early enough, but because the weather was bad, I did not want to get up, and I must have my right to speak”.

That the prisoner’s owner got angry over this answer and gave the prisoner a blow with, as the prisoner expresses himself, a broomstick, and again ordered him to be silent; to which the prisoner said that he did not want to be silent and would preserve his right to speak. The prisoner’s owner then gave him two more blows, which did not have any better result, since the prisoner, on receiving these blows, expressed himself, in no uncertain terms, in this manner: “I do not want to be silent, and I must retain my right to speak”, while adding: “*Baas* must stop beating me like this”.

That hereupon the prisoner’s owner fetched a so-called hind oxen *sjambok*[^1] and gave the prisoner a lash with it. That finally the prisoner did not scruple to give such free rein to his disobedient behaviour as to hold the *sjambok* tight with his left hand and then to cut it with a knife, which he claimed to have taken off his bed, yet, according to the evidence of his owner, to have taken from his pocket. This made the prisoner’s owner decide to leave the kitchen and to have the prisoner tied up the following morning and to hand him over to the *veldwagtmeester* of the district, through which the prisoner came into the hands of justice.

And since offences like these cannot be allowed to pass unpunished in a country where justice is administered as it should be, but, on the contrary, ought to be punished most severely as an example and deterrent to other malefactors.

Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, serving today, having read and considered with attention the written *crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie* drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoner by the landdrost of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, the *koopman* Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, in his official capacity, as well as having noted the voluntary confession of the prisoner, as also everything which further served the case and could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the United Netherlands, and having judged the prisoner Caesar van Madagascar, their honours are sentencing the same with this: to be taken to the place where criminal sentences are usually executed here and there to be handed over to the executioner, to be tied to the stake, to be severely scourged with rods on his bare back, and afterwards to be branded, as also to be riveted in chains and thus to serve for the period of 25 successive years without wages on the honourable Company’s public works on Robben Island, or elsewhere, with sentencing of the prisoner to the costs and expenditure of justice, and denying the further or otherwise drawn-up *eijsch* or delivered *conclusie* of the officer.[^2]

Thus done and sentenced at the Cape of Good Hope on 7 October 1793, as also published on 9 November and executed on the same day.

Let the sentence be done, \[signed\] A.J. Sluijsken.

[^2]: This sentence was recorded in the *regtsrollen*, CJ 75, ff. 211-12. In response to the charge, Caesar stated that his owner had attacked him with a broomstick and then with a *sjambok*, and that he had only stated that he would inspan oxen early the following morning and had done no wrong, CJ 75, f. 204.
