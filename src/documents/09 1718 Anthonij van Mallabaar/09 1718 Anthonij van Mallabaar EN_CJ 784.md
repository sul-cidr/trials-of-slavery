# ANTHONIJ VAN MALLABAAR

**CJ 784** Sententiën, 1717-1725, ff. 81-4.

Since Anthonij van Mallabaar, 24 years old at a guess, bondsman of the farmer Hendrik Moel, currently their honours’ prisoner, has voluntarily and freely confessed, without torture or coercion of bonds, of irons, or any threat of suchlike; and also since it has appeared evident to the honourable Council of Justice of this government:

How the prisoner, in the month of August this year, did not scruple nor hesitate to go from his master’s farm to the honourable independent fiscal, Cornelis van Beaumont, and to falsely accuse his aforesaid master of having beaten to death a certain slave by the name of Januarij van Mallabaar.

\<That the prisoner, had done this on his own accord, solely to avenge himself in this wicked way on his said master, because (as the prisoner asserts) the same beats and torments him daily.\>[^1]

That the prisoner had been the first to have found lying dead the aforesaid slave Anthonij,[^2] without being able to produce anything further as verification for his false accusation, nor to prove his claim.

All of which are matters of the most evil consequences, which may under no circumstances be tolerated in a country where justice is administered properly, but should be averted and punished most severely as an example and deterrent to all such villains.

Therefore, the honourable Council of Justice of this government, serving today, having seen and read the written *crimineelen eijsch en conclusie*, produced by the honourable landdrost Jacob Voet in his official capacity, as also the prisoner’s voluntary confession, properly verified in court, with the other documents bearing upon the case, further having pondered with attention everything that could possibly serve the case and could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the free United Netherlands, having judged the prisoner, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the place where criminal sentences are usually executed here and there to be handed over to the executioner and to be tied to a stake, to be scourged on the bare back with rods and to be branded, afterwards to be sent home to his master, provided the same pays the costs and expenditure of justice.[^3]

Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 1 December 1718.

Pronounced and executed on the 3^rd^ thereupon.

\[signed\] M.P. Chavonnes, A. Cranendronk, K.J. Slotsboo, Jan de la Fontaine, Jn. Aldersz, Clis. Barentsz, C. Valk, G. v. Baarsenburg, Hk. Donker, Hk. Möller, Fk. Russouw.

In my presence, \[signed\] Dl. Thibault, secretary.

[^1]: The paragraph between angled brackets is crossed out lightly in the original (but remains perfectly legible).

[^2]: This is clearly a mistake by the scribe. The dead slave was Januarij; Anthonij was the accused.

[^3]: This sentence was also recorded in the *regtsrollen* CJ 7 \[1718\], ff. 59-60.
