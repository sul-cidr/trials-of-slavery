Article 2: When the prisoner came to report to the honourable fiscal that his master had supposedly beaten to death a slave?

Answer: About a month ago.

Article 3: If the prisoner meant with this Januarij van Malabaer, at that time a cattle herder on his master’s post?

Answer: Yes.

Article 4: If three cattle of his master had gone missing shortly one after the other, while the prisoner had still been at the post, and if this had been the result of the said Januarij’s negligence?

Answer: Yes.

Article 5: If the said Januarij then fled, and was brought home to his master, after some days, by the farmer Jan Steenkamp?

Answer: That two *jongens* of Jan Steenkamp brought Januarij home, and that Steenkamp also came there shortly thereafter.

Article 6: If it had been at this time that Januarij on the order of his master was chastised by the other *jongens*? Answer: Yes.

Article 7: If this *jongen* ran away again afterwards, and was again brought home by the said Steenkamp and Coenraad Boom, and absented himself that very same evening for the third time?

Answer: That after the punishment he received, this *jongen*, because he could not move well, went to lie down in the bushes, and was found there by Jan Steenkamp and Coenraad Boom and brought home.

Article 8: Where the prisoner found Januarij \[lying\] for dead, and who else was present and saw this?

Answer: That on the same day that the *jongen* had been brought home by Steenkamp and Boom, the *baas* had put him to work, and, while working, had yet again beaten this *jongen* with a sjambok and kicked him until the *jongen* fell to the ground, which is when he, on the order of his master, picked up this *jongen* and took him to a little hut. That after they had milked in the evening, the shepherd Januari van Bengalen found this beaten Januarij dead, and told all the slaves that he had found the *jongen* dead, and that *nobody* had seen him dead, except for the aforesaid Janarij who had told them this.

Article 9: If he had given this report to the honourable fiscal of his own volition, or if he had been incited by somebody, and who that was?

Answer: They, the slaves, amongst themselves.

Article 10: Where Januarij was buried and by whom? Answer: It was not done by the slaves, it must have been done by the *baas*, that they had sought long for the place but could not find it.

Article 11: What excuse he could offer for this, his sham?

Answer: Not being able to give any excuse except for what he had said before.
