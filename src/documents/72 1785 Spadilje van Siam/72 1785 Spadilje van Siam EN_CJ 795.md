Since Spadiltje, slave of the free black Albert Isaaksz, twenty five years old at a guess, currently their honours’ prisoners, has voluntarily confessed and, from the other evidence produced in the case, it has appeared evident to the honourable Council of Justice:

That the prisoner became a fugitive now fully three months ago and maintained himself both here and elsewhere in the rural areas, as well as in the region of Hanglip, where a certain runaway slave by the name of Job, belonging to the widow of the late burgher lieutenant Jan Hendrik Ekkert,[^1] and yet another runaway slave, whose name the prisoner says he does not know, came to join him.

That the prisoner and his aforementioned comrades set out to the mountains of False Bay[^2] and stayed in the region of Kalk Bay, which is where the aforesaid Job forged the plan to break into the *slagthuijs[^3] * of the honourable Company in Baaij Fals and to commit theft. So that, after the said Job had made that plan known to the prisoner and the other *jongen*, they all went together during the night of the 22^nd^ of the past month August, to the aforesaid Baaij Fals, when Job climbed onto the roof, which is rather low, of the said *slagthuijs* and made an opening in the thatch of the roof by breaking or cutting to pieces the cabled yarn, through which he went into the *slagthuijs*, while the prisoner and his comrade remained outside, keeping watch.

That the aforesaid Job, after having broken open a chest in the said *slagthuijs*, stole from it a sum of three hundred and fifty rixdollars and four *schellingen*, consisting both of paper money[^4] and a variety of silver coins, and among which there was also a guinea, as well as a black velvet jacket, a brown silk frock and a white shirt.

That the aforesaid Job came to the prisoner with these stolen goods and money, and in the dark gave part of the cash to him, as well as the black jacket; among which cash the prisoner afterwards found a piece of gold money. After this, the said Job and his comrade went from there to some other place with the rest of the money and clothes, while the prisoner remained in Baaij Fals.

That on a certain night, a day or three afterwards, the prisoner went into the tavern of Baaij Fals[^5] to have a drink, but that the people there, when they saw that the prisoner had some money with him, took him for a deserter and, moreover, also suspected him to have committed the aforesaid theft. So that he was taken prisoner by these people, searched, and then delivered into the hands of justice.

But since such crimes, conspiracies and robberies can under no circumstances be left unpunished in a country where justice is properly administered, and ought to be punished, according to the merits of the case, as an example to other similar malefactors.

Thus it is, that the aforementioned honourable Council of Justice, having read and considered the written *crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie* drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoner by the interim fiscal, *Sieur* Gabriel Exter, in his official capacity, as well as having noted everything that served in the case and could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the United Netherlands, and having judged the prisoner, Spadilje van Siam, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the usual place of execution, there to be handed over to the executioner, to be exposed with the rope around his neck under the gallows, further to be tied to a stake and to be severely scourged with rods on his bare back, as well as to be branded, then to be riveted in chains in which to labour without payment on the public works of the honourable Company on Robben Island for the duration of his life, with sentencing to the costs and expenditure of justice.[^6]

Thus done and sentenced at the Cape of Good Hope on 22 September 1785, as also pronounced and executed on the 1^st^ of the following month October and executed on the same day.[^7]

[^1]: This was Job van Madagascar, who was a deserter for about two years before he was eventually captured in December 1786 and sentenced; see 1786 Job van Madagascar et al. He also features in 1786 October van Madagascar et al.

[^2]: In this case ‘False Bay’ refer to the region, while the name ‘Baaij Fals’ denotes the settlement around the outpost at Simon’s Bay (see 1755 Patientie van Manacabo).

[^3]: In order to provide fresh meat for ships anchoring at Simon’s Bay, the Company was provided with live sheep on a monthly basis by the meat *pachter*. These were kept, and slaughtered as needed, at a purpose-built building, close to the shore (Sleigh 1993: 310, 315).

[^4]: On the recent introduction of paper money into the colony, see 1791 Baatjoe, n. 1.

[^5]: According to a description of Baaij Fals three years later, there was a ‘wine house’ there which also served as a brothel (Dawe 2003: 110; see also Sleigh 1993: 306-7).

[^6]: Spadilje was charged on 22 August and confessed his guilt. The case was held over while the documentation was circulated among the members of the Council of Justice until 22 September, when this sentence was passed, CJ 67, ff. 82 and 88. The sentence was that recommended in the *eijsch*, CJ 421, ff. 168-69. Documentation for this case also includes the interrogation of Spadilje and the testimony of Willem Bergh, who was in charge of the Company *slagthuijs*, CJ 421, ff. 171-83.

[^7]: The last part of this sentence (from ‘den 1^e^ ...’ onwards) was added later in a different handwriting, hence the repitition of information.
