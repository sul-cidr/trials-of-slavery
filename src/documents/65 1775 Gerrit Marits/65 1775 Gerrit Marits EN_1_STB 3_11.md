Statement given on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Marthinus Adrianus Bergh, by the burgher Gerrit Marits, of competent age, which is of the following content, namely:

On 22 February of this year – after the *veldkorporaal* of the middle Roggeveld, Hendrik Olivier, had ridden off to the Cape, and who, beforehand, had handed over to the testifier his farm and function as corporal there – when the testifier, armed with a gun loaded with a bullet, had set out to the veld with the Bushmen to look after the livestock of the aforesaid Olivier, he came across a slave with a group of tame goats in the mountain who, when the testifier called out that he should give himself up as prisoner, immediately proceeded to flee by running away. Upon this, the testifier shot at him, whereupon the said slave at once turned around and, when he got to the testifier, sat down on the ground, which is when the testifier recognised him as a runaway *jongen*, by the name of Fortuijn, of the farmer Cornelis Coetze Cornerlisz. who lived in the said veld.[^1] At the same time, the testifier discovered that the bullet had gone through his body and his left arm (which, because of this, was in pieces), of which case the testifier informed the said Coetze as soon as possible. The aforementioned slave Fortuijn, after he was taken from there to the farm of the aforesaid Olivier, came to die of the aforementioned wounds the following day at sunset.

The testifier declares further that the said slave Fortuijn, in the presence of his owner and the testifier, answered to the question of how he supported himself during his desertion, that he was supported and provided with food by a slave of aforementioned Olivier, named April.

There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing, if so required, to subsequently confirm the above with solemn oaths.

Thus related at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch on 8 June 1775 in the presence of the burghers Johannes Joacobus Rijniers and Johannes Victor, requested as witnesses hereto.
