# GERRIT MARITS

*Gerrit Marits, acting veldcorporaal[^1] in the Roggeveld, here reports to the Stellenbosch landdrost that he had shot a slave he encountered in the veld. The fact that he had called upon the slave to surrender himself was sufficient warning. No action was taken against Marits. The incident shows how dangerous it was for slaves to be in the veld without permission: only after he had been shot did Marits recognise him as a runaway.[^2]*

[^1]: On the development and significance of this office, see Botha 1962, vol. II: 109-12. This Gerrit (Stephanus) Maritz was the uncle of the Voortrekker leader Gert Maritz and later played an important role in the commandos against the Khoisan in the Roggeveld in the 1790s.

[^2]: *Veldcorporaals*, *veldwagtmeesters* and commandos did not have to obtain permission to act and could institute search parties and execute justice as they saw fit, as long as they gave a report of it later (Newton-King 1999: 66). Athough this is a *relaas*, called for by the landdrost, rather than a letter or report initiated by Marits, there is no record that the matter was taken further.
