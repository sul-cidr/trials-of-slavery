**1/STB 3/10** Criminele Verklaringen, 1749-1758, unpaginated.

Today, 29 November 1749, there appears before me, Jean Benjamin d’Aillij, secretary of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the slave Julij van Bengalen, being of competent age, bondsman of the farmer Jan Lategaan, living on the same’s farm situated in the Wagenmakersvallei, who, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Adriaan van Schoor, declares it to be true:

That a month or two ago now, without knowing the exact day or date, when the deponent was busy working in the garden during the afternoon, he was called by his owner to come to the house and that when he came into the house, he, on the order of his master, had to carry his child on his arm. While doing this, he saw his aforementioned master in the kitchen, tying together the hands of his woman slave, Regina van Ternaten, on her back with a *riem*, which is when the deponent, on the order of his *baas*, gave the said woman slave some lashes with the *sjambok* on her buttocks. Lategaan then also beat the aforementioned Regina with the *sjambok*, both on her back and on her buttocks, while in the meantime the deponent was sent by his owner to work in the garden, whither he indeed went. The farmer Jacob Pienaar then arrived at his owner’s farm, when the deponent was called home again by his owner, and also went thither, and was told by his master that he should lay the abovementioned *meijd*, who was in the room, by the fire. Yet, when the deponent came into the room, he noticed that the said Regina was cold in the face and not saying a word, and when the deponent warned his aforesaid owner about this, he answered that the *meijd* was just pretending. Some time after this, the deponent again repaired to his work.

That afterwards, when the aforesaid Jacob Pienaar had ridden off, and the deponent had finished his work by evening and had gone to the house, he, on the order of his owner, made a bed for the said woman slave in the *voorhuijs*, after which he took her from the room into the *voorhuijs*, holding her under the arms, and laid her down on the said bed. That the deponent warmed some food for himself and ate, and then went to sleep in the kitchen, being roused early in the morning by his owner and ordered to light something, which the deponent indeed did, and then saw that the aforesaid woman slave was no longer there, although her bed was still in the *voorhuijs*. The deponent’s owner then asked him where the aforementioned Regina was, to which the deponent answered that he did not know.

That some days after this, when the Hottentot woman Catrijn, who looks after the cattle herd of his owner,[^1] came home in the evening, she told him that, going past a porcupine hole on the mountain above the farm of the deponent’s owner, she became aware of a great stench, and that she was of the opinion that a dead human being must be lying in there. It occurred then to the deponent that it could possibly be the aforementioned woman slave Regina lying there in that hole, and he then told the said Hottentot woman that she should urgently inform the farmer Andries du Toit junior of this.

Finally, the deponent declares that when, on the order of the petitioner, and in the presence of the deputised *heemraden*, the corpse was inspected on the mountain above the farm of his owner, he saw on it the clothes that the abovementioned woman slave Regina was wearing on the day before she went missing.

There being nothing further to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing, if so desired, to subsequently confirm the above.

Thus recorded at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch, in the presence of the burghers Gerrit Kemp and Johan George Zorn, requested hereto as witnesses.

This X is the mark of the deponent.

Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Adriaan van Schoor, by the farmer Jan Lategaan, of competent age, being of the following content:

That about two months ago now, without being able to determine the precise day or date, the testifier sent out his slave, named Regina van Ternaten, to the veld to fetch wood and as the said slave did not come back again, he also went out into the veld in order to look for her. The testifier then found her lying asleep and, after waking her up, he made her go to the house, meanwhile giving her some lashes with the *sjambok* on her legs.

That when the testifier got home, he ordered his slave *jongen*, Julij van Bengalen, to beat the said slave on her buttocks with the *sjambok*, which was done. The aforementioned woman slave was afterwards ordered by the testifier to sift flour in the room and, while she was busy with this, the farmer Jacob Pinard arrived on the farm of the testifier and departed again a short while thereafter. That at night the aforementioned slave Regina lay herself down in the *voorhuijs* to sleep and, when the testifier got up early in the morning, he discovered that the said slave was no longer in the house, without being able, after much searching, to find her again.

Finally the testifier declares that when, on the order of the petitioner, and in the presence of the deputised *heemraden*, the corpse was inspected on the mountain above his farm, he saw on it the clothes that the abovementioned slave Regina was wearing the day before she went missing.

There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing, if it may be required, to subsequently confirm this, his statement, at any time.

Thus recorded in the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch on 29 November 1749 in the presence of the lay reader Abraham Faure and the burgher Gerrit Kemp, requested hereto as witnesses.

[^1]: When Khoikhoi were employed on farms, they tended to work as stock herders (although they were also used as field workers), but it is unusual to find a woman in this position. Usually Khoi women were used for domestic service or as child minders, especially in the interior (Elphick & Malherbe 1989: 28-9; Biewenga 1999: 105-8).
