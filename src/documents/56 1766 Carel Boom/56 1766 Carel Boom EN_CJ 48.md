# CAREL BOOM

**CJ 48** Crimineele Regtsrolle des Casteels de Goede Hoop, 1766, ff. 54-6.

Sunday, 30 March 1766.

By order of the honourable president and on the proposition of the honourable independent fiscal, Jan Willem Cloppenburg, which has been circulated \[amongst the members of the Council of Justice\], viz. if it would not be a good thing, as an example and deterrent to other God-forsaken scoundrels, that the body of the porter of the honourable Company’s slave lodge, by the name of Carel Boom, who took his own life miserably with a pistol shot early during the night yesterday, be buried under the gallows by the executioner;[^1] since this self-murderer had at first, a moment before killing himself, shot a woman slave of the honourable Company, by the name of Cornelia van Piloane, with a different pistol and wounded her on the head; which wound, according to the report made by the chief surgeon, may well become fatal, and also since it appears from the circumstances that it was the intention of the said Carel Boom to take the life of that woman slave in this way, since she, after having had a relationship with him for a long time, had ended it. Consequently, on last Monday, in order to force her to continue their relationship for longer, he wrathfully wounded the aforesaid Cornelia with a knife on her hand; which she at that time, in order to exculpate him, claimed to have happened when she was cutting cheese.[^2]

The members present, having taken these motives into account, and since such a cruel and evil-minded creature does not merit an honourable burial, accept and allow the proposition made by the honourable independent fiscal.

Cape of Good Hope, the date as above.

In my presence, \[signed\] C.L. Neethling, secretary.

[^1]: This was a particularly dishonourable end for Boom since association with the executioner was considered highly polluting, and burial below the gallows a fate for criminals (see 1719 Jonas van Manado, n. 13). It is not clear whether this was because he had committed suicide or because of his attack on one of the Company’s slaves. The description of Boom as a ‘wreed en boosaardig schepsel’ (cruel and malicious creature) suggests both. Upham 2001b argues that suicides by Europeans were not punished judicially, yet this particular case was considered important enough for an emergency meeting of the Council to be held on a Sunday.

[^2]: The slaves in the Lodge got weekly rations which they cooked themselves (Geyser 1958: 24 and Schoeman 2001: 531-32).
