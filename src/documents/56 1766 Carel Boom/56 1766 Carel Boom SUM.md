# CAREL BOOM

*This record of an emergency Sunday meeting of the Council of Justice tells the suicide of Carel Boom,[^1] the ‘portier’ at the Company’s Slave Lodge in Cape Town. It gives a brief insight into this key building for slaves. The Lodge housed the slaves owned by the Company itself, as well as the convict* bandieten *(about 580 altogether in the mid-1760s), except for those who worked on the outposts away from the town.[^2] Boom had formed a relationship with the slave Cornelia van Piloane.[^3] When she wanted to break it, Boom tried to force her and wounded her in the process, displaying a jealousy shown in other cases by male slaves towards their female partners.*

[^1]: Carel Boom van Koningsburg arrived at the Cape in 1749 as a soldier and was employed as *portier* of the Slave Lodge (the gatekeeper, whose job it was to remove the key each night as a precaution against arson attempts by the inmates, Shell 1994: 177-78). He left behind 158 guilders, but no will, VOC 13988, f. 163.

[^2]: On the Slave Lodge, see Geyser 1958: 6-41; Shell 1994: 172-205; Vollgraaff 1997; and Schoeman 2001: 542-72.

[^3]: There is no record of Cornelia van Piloane in the death registers of Company slaves, as recorded in the *Attestatiën* of the Council of Policy (Duvenage et al. 2000).
