In a reversal of many of the cases that came to the Council of Justice, this one deals with four Company woodcutters who were caught stealing sheep from the Company’s corral at Groote Schuur by slaves, one of whom they killed.[^1] The case shows that low-ranking Company employees were as desperate for food as other members of the colony’s underclasses and could be equally unruly and opportunistic.
