*In a reversal of many of the cases that came to the Council of Justice, this one deals with four Company woodcutters who were caught stealing sheep from the Company’s corral at Groote Schuur by slaves, one of whom they killed.[^1] The case shows that low-ranking Company employees were as desperate for food as other members of the colony’s underclasses and could be equally unruly and opportunistic.*

[^1]: Testimonies from each of the accused, five witnesses and two *eijschen* are included in the documentation for this case, CJ 343, ff. 104-56. We include here Coridon’s evidence as a rare example of slave testimony against a ‘European’ prisoner. Slave testimony in court was in theory only accepted as the basis for convictions when there was corroborating evidence from other witnesses, but in practice, as these records reveal, it was frequently used. Company-owned slaves were frequently employed on outposts such as this, Shell 1994: 178 and Sleigh 1993: 117-25.
