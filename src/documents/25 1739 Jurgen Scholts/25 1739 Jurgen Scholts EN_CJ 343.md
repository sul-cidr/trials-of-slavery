**CJ 343** Criminele Process Stukken, 1739, ff. 123r-v.

Testimony given, on the requisition of the *onderkoopman*, *Sieur* Johannes Needer, acting as fiscal for the interim, by the slave Coridon, belonging to the head of *De Schuur*, Gibbelaar, being of the following contents:

That the testifier, together with the slave Paris, also belonging to his owner, were ordered to look after the corral last night since sheep had been stolen from there on several occasions at night, which is why they were both on guard that night, and while they were there, two Europeans entered at twelve o’clock, which is when the testifier, as one of these Dutchmen[^1] was laying hold of a sheep, took him on, wanting to throw him onto the ground, whereupon this European cut the testifier with a knife across his stomach, at which he fell down helplessly and this European ran away. When these two Dutchmen came into the corral, there were two other Dutchmen in front of the corral.

Thus related at the honourable Company’s *Schuur* on 23 January 1739, before the honourables J.T. Rhenius and P.R. de Savoije, members from the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, who, together with the testifier and me, the secretary, have properly signed the original of this.

Which I declare, \[signed\] Js. de Grandpreez, secretary.

[^1]: This word (which is sometimes written *Duusman*) developed a special meaning at the Cape, eventually coming to mean any white person, whether necessarily of Dutch descent or not (Scholtz 1965: 138-39).
