To my lord, the honourable N. Beeomondt, independent fiscal at the Cape of Good Hope.

My Lord,

This serves to inform your honour that a male slave, named Aron \[*sic*\] van Bengaalen, belonging to me, received some blows yesterday, whereupon the aforenamed began his wicked design by tearing his clothes to pieces and, in the evening, set the roof of the wine house on fire with a little flue, whereupon he ran to the mountain above my house, where he was found by Johannes Kruijwag and Henderik Rooden. The same had cut himself with a razor in his neck, which razor was found in his pocket. Whereupon since, as chance would have it, *Monsieur* Fij\[l\] was in the Tijgerbergen, the same was requested to examine the delinquent. *Monsieur* Fijl, after having laid a loose bandage \[on the wound\], found him fit to be sent to the Cape for the disposal of my lord and, on account of this, I hand him over totally to the judge.

My Lord, your honour’s obedient servant,

The Tijgerbergen, 26 November in the year 1716,

This X is the mark of Piter van der Westhuijsen.

Statement of Gerrit Mos concerning the arson on his parents’ farm, situated in the Tijgerbergen, going as follows:

That on the day before yesterday, the 25^th^ of this month, when one of their slaves, by the name of Aaron van Bengaalen, was wanting to give some orders to the other slaves, he was punished with some blows by the undersigned and upon which he, Aaron, was rather disinclined to come and eat at midday. That all the slaves together, after they had eaten in the evening, and after saying goodnight as per usual, went to sleep, as also the undersigned who, together with his parents, retired to rest. That, at a guess, about midnight, a slave, named Baltsen van Bengalen, came to the house and called: “Fire, fire”, whereupon the undersigned, together with his parents and an old man who lived there in the house, went outdoors and saw that the cellar was on fire. Upon which they used all means to extinguish the same and managed to put out this fire with the first crow of the cocks, which is when they noticed that the aforementioned Aaron was absent from his post, finding in the yard his coat and blanket torn to pieces. That the undersigned rode out early in the morning to the Tijgerbergen to inform the people living there of the arson and also the flight of the said slave Aaron. That when the undersigned came back home, he heard it said that the aforementioned Aaron was hiding thereabouts, whereupon the undersigned, together with his brother-in-law Pieter van der Westhuijsen and the burgher Anthonij van Rooijen, set out thence, and found Aaron lying in a little bush with a cut on his throat, having at this time also a razor in his pocket, on which was some blood. That they had him, Aaron, brought to the house where he, upon questioning, confessed to have committed the arson, whereupon the undersigned immediately brought him to the Cape and then handed him over to the honourable Officer.

Thus related in the Castle of Good Hope, this 27^th^ of November 1716.

Verification

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the aforementioned interrogated slave Aaron van Bengalen, who, after the questions above and the answers given to them had been read out clearly and plainly, word by word, declares to fully persist with them, not desiring that anything more should be added or taken from them, except on article 16, viz.: that Jan Cruijwagen junior and one Hendrik Roode had first found him with the cut on his throat above the wheatfields of Jan Mijndertsz Cruijwagen, who then warned his masters, and that he was then taken prisoner as in article 16; declaring and confessing further that he had done this deed because Gerrit Mos, the step-son of Pieter van der Westhuijsen, treated him badly on a daily basis, that he on several occasions gave complaints about this to the aforementioned Van der Westhuijsen, to which he had added that, if such improper punishment continues, he would come to commit, at one time or the other, something unfortunate, and for this reason requested that he must then not be reproached for it, but that he should rather be sold by his master.

Thus done and verified, and interpreted in both the Dutch and Portuguese languages, and confessed by him, the interrogatee, who speaks the Dutch language reasonably well, in the Castle of Good Hope on 12 February 1717.

This X is the mark of the slave Aaron van Bengalen.

[^1]: Cotton was not produced at the Cape, but Aaron’s blanket was most likely a so-called *palempoer*, a thin blanket padded with cotton (like a quilt), commonly used in the East Indies and imported to the Cape for use by both slaves and colonists (see Schoeman 2001: 43 and 416) .
