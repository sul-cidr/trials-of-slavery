# AARON VAN BENGALEN

**CJ 784** Sententiën, 1717-1725, ff. 7-11.

Since Aaron van Bengalen, 40 years old at a guess, bondsman of the burgher and farmer Pieter van der Westhuijsen, currently their lordships’ prisoner, voluntarily confessed and admitted, without torture or force of bonds, of irons, or the least threat of suchlike, and it has fully appeared to the honourable Council of Justice:

That the prisoner, because (as he asserts) of some conversations which he had held with one so-called Claas de Sterrekijker about the runaway slaves of his aforementioned master, and which concerned his master’s stepson, named Gerrit Mos, he received some blows from him, Mos, on the day before his apprehension.

That the prisoner, after having received this beating, absented himself that midday from the usual meal, because (as he says) his body was aching and he had no desire to eat; that he, however, ate with the other slaves in the evening, after which he went to lie by the door, without sleeping.

That the prisoner, when his masters were lying asleep, went outside the house at about three o’clock in the night, without knowing whether the other slaves were sleeping or awake at this time; that he went from the house with the intention to set the same on fire from the outside.

That the prisoner, in order to achieve this atrocious crime, tore his coat and blanket to pieces and prepared fuel from it, which he lighted with a burning pipe, and then instantly threw this burning fuel onto the roof of the cellar or winehouse of his master and set the same on fire with it at about three o’clock during the night.

That the prisoner, after having performed this heinous deed, set out in flight to the wheat fields of Jan Mijndertsz Cruijwagen where he, for fear of a well-deserved punishment, gave himself a cut on his throat with a razor.

That the prisoner remained lying at that place with this wound until early in the morning, when he was found there by Jan Cruijwagen junior and one Hendrik Roode, who first took him to his master’s farm, from where he was immediately delivered into the hands of justice.

All of which are matters of the most evil and dangerous consequences, which under no circumstances should be tolerated in a country where justice is clearly administered, but must be prevented and punished most severely and rigorously, as a warning and deterrent to others.

Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice of this government, serving today, having seen and read the written *crimineelen eijsch en conclusie*, drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoner by the honourable independent fiscal, Cornelis van Beaumont, in his official capacity, as well as having noted the voluntary confession taken from the prisoner, which was moreover also properly verified in court, together with the other papers and documents which bear upon the case, besides having carefully pondered, with maturely deliberated counsel, everything that possibly served the case and could have moved their honours, doing right in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the free United Netherlands, and, having judged the prisoner, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the place where criminal justice is usually performed here, and there to be handed over to the executioner, to be tied to a stake and, after first having been half strangled, to be scorched to death; [^1] further, his dead body to be dragged through their Lordships’ streets to the outer place of execution, and there to be placed upon a wheel, to remain for as long until being consumed by the air and the birds of heaven, with the costs.

Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 8 April 1717.

Pronounced and executed on the 10^th^ thereupon.

[^1]: The *eijsch* recommended that Aaron be burnt alive ‘tot spectakel en afschrik van anderen’ (as a spectacle and deterrent to others), CJ 321, document 6, but in the event the sentence was changed to that recorded here, CJ 6 \[1717\], ff. 114-15. Such a fate is described by Mentzel: ‘A more painful death is by a process of slow strangulation, while a “kaffir” holds a bundle of burning reeds close to the face’ (1925: 133). The punishment was grimly appropriate for arsonists, those who had played with fire. For a similar case, see 1724 Andries van Ceijlon.
