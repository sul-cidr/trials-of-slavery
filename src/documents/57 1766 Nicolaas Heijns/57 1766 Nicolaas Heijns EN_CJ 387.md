*Dictum ter rolle*.

Honourable lord and lords,

As verification of this dictum the *eijscher* has the honour, in his official capacity, to inform your honours that, on the 10^th^ of the previous month January, a slave *meijd*, by the name of Flora van Bengale, bondswoman of the defendant, the burgher Nicolaas Godfried Heijns,[^1] brought a complaint to the *eijscher*, viz. that, shortly before noon, her said owner suddenly came into the kitchen from the room where he, without her being aware of this, had been lying asleep, when he, not only without any cause and merely under the pretext of saying: “Why do you shout like that! I cannot sleep!”, first gave her a few slaps with his hand, but also, shortly thereafter, when she was standing in the kitchen by the hearth, the defendant again came to her from the room and hit her with an iron ash shovel on the right-hand side of her head in such a way that the blood came streaming from the inflicted wound so that she became faint due to the heavy bleeding. Yet, a short while thereafter, the defendant even returned for a third time from the room and tried to give her a second blow with the same ash shovel, but was, however, prevented from doing this through the intervention of his son, Hendrik, who said that she, Flora, was already bleeding heavily from the first blow she had received. Which can be seen in greater detail in the statement of the wounded slave Flora, attached herewith under the letter A.[^2]

For which reason the *eijscher* considered it prudent to send this *meijd* to the guardroom and to have her wounds dressed there by one of the chief surgeons from the honourable Company’s hospital. Which is when, as shown in the statement of the second chief surgeon, attached herewith under the letter D, it was found that the deep wound, fully two fingers big, caused by the aforementioned blow given to this slave, penetrated the top part of the back skull on the right-hand side, exposing its bone, being accompanied with heavy bleeding and bruising of the surrounding parts.

Moreover, the *eijscher* also, in order to be more fully informed of the truth and circumstances of this case, and whether or not it squares with the truth, viz. that the defendant had given the *meijd* a blow with an ash shovel and that she thus received the wound, collected the testimonies, attached herewith under the letters B and C, of the members of the defendant’s household who were present and to whom it would be known best. In which your honours too will be able to see most clearly the anger and wrath of the defendant.

In this way the defendant has entirely exceeded the level of chastisement which is permitted to an owner in accordance with our laws, viz. to punish his slaves with the hand, stick or *sjambok* etc., but in no way to maltreat them, or to injure them bloodily with ash shovels or other similar instruments; even to such an extent that this blow may have caused a mortal wound, or at least that death, through an additional accident such as that it may not have been attended to in time, could easily have resulted from it, seeing that the blood which flowed from the wound could hardly be stanched, and that fainting had already followed it.[^3] For this reason the *eijscher*, in his official capacity, presumes to conclude with good justice against the defendant, as follows:

Concluding with this that the defendant, Nicolaas Godfried Heijns, with certain judgment by your honours, be sentenced to a monetary fine of one hundred rixdollars *pro fisco* and, moreover, to be sharply reprimanded in court, with sentencing to the costs, and further that the slave *meijd* Flora be sold, for the defendant’s profit, in public so that she may never again fall into the hands of the defendant or his \[family\]. Or to any other similar end as your honours would deem just and fair.

\[signed\] J.W. Cloppenburg.

Exhibit in court, 13 February in the year 1766.

**CJ 387** Criminele Process Stukken, 1766, ff. 129-31.

Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Jan Willem Cloppenburg, by the slave Flora van Bengalen, bondswoman of the burgher Nicolaas Godfried Heijns, going as follows:

That on a certain morning, at about ten o’clock, one month ago now at a guess, without knowing the precise day or date, the testifier went out, on the order of her mistress, to sell green almonds and then arrived back home after eleven o’clock when her mistress came from the front room to her in the *voorhuijs* and asked the testifier if she had sold anything. When the testifier answered this with: “No”, her mistress ordered her to go to the kitchen.

That while the testifier was busy in the kitchen, her owner who, without her knowing this, had been lying asleep in the front room, suddenly came from that room and gave her about three slaps with his hand, saying: “Why are you screaming like this, I cannot sleep”.

That her said owner then returned to the front room, while the testifier remained in the kitchen, but that, shortly thereupon, he again came from that room into the kitchen and went to the testifier, who was standing at the hearth in the presence of both her owner’s sons, Hendrik and Nicolaas, and on this occasion hit a hole in the right-hand side of her head with an iron ash shovel lying there; whereupon her owner went back to the room for the second time, but shortly thereafter returned to the kitchen and tried to deal the testifier a second blow with the ash shovel.

That the testifier’s owner – who had been prevented from accomplishing this by his aforementioned son Hendrik, who said that the testifier was already bleeding from the first blow – then ordered her to serve at the table upon which the testifier’s fellow slave Dela had meanwhile laid the meal; but that the testifier, because the blood streamed from the inflicted wound down her face, became faint and, on the repeated threat of her owner, went to the room and stood there leaning against the post of the door.

That the testifier remained standing in the door of the room during the meal, with the wound continuing to bleed steadily, that after the meal her owner had his aforementioned son Hendrik cut her hair and wash out the wound with brandy, which did not, however, succeed in stanching the blood; for which reason the testifier lodged her complaint concerning this with the honourable petitioner.

There being nothing more to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of her statement as in the text, with presentation to subsequently confirm the same, if so required.

Thus related at the office of the secretary of justice of the Castle of Good Hope on 30 January 1766 in the presence of the clerks Jochem Hendk. Borgwedel and Pieter Caspar Broedersz, as witnesses, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the testifier and me, the sworn clerk.

Which I declare, \[signed\] L.S. Faber, sworn clerk.

**CJ 387** Criminele Process Stukken, 1766, ff. 129-31.

Today, 3 February 1766, there appears before me, Lucas Sigismundus Faber, sworn clerk in the office of the secretary of justice of this government, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the slave Dela van Bengalen, belonging to the burgher Nicolaas Godfried Heijns, of competent age, who, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Jan Willem Cloppenburg, declares it to be true:

That fully a month ago now, probably on a certain Monday, without however being able to remember the date, the deponent’s fellow slave, Flora van Bengalen, went out in the morning to sell green almonds, and returned home again at eleven o’clock, when she stood in the *voorhuijs* and reported about the sale of these almonds to her *juffrouw*, the wife of the aforementioned Heijns, who was sitting in the room.

That the reporter’s owner, who had been lying in that room on a bed, and who was somewhat drunk, thereupon started swearing and, while the aforementioned Flora went to the kitchen, got up from the bed and also went to the kitchen, which is when the said owner of the deponent, as soon as he had entered through the kitchen door, asked the aforementioned Flora whether she knew he had been sleeping on the bed in the room.

That when Flora answered: “No” to this, the deponent’s owner gave the said Flora about four slaps in her face. When the aforementioned slave then retreated to the hearth, which was at the other side of the kitchen, the deponent’s owner took up an ash shovel lying by the hearth, and gave the said Flora a blow with it on the right-hand side of her head, whereupon the deponent’s owner wanted to continue with a further blow, but was prevented from it by his son, Hendrik Heijns, who grabbed his hand while saying: “Oh, father”.

That the deponent’s said owner then went to the room, sat down at the table, on which the deponent had meanwhile laid the meal, and called the slave Flora from the kitchen to come and serve at the table. However, the said Flora, who was bleeding heavily from the blow she had received on her head, became faint, and stood leaning with her head against one of the posts \[of the door\], which is when the aforementioned owner of the deponent asked Flora if she wanted to have a second blow, but that she answered: “No” to this. When the deponent’s owner had eaten and afterwards went to rest, his son, by the name of Hendrik, cut Flora’s hair from her head and cleaned her wound with wine, but since this bleeding could not be stanched, Flora went from the house out of fear and went to the honourable petitioner in order to complain about this incident.

There being nothing more to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of her statement as in the text, with presentation to subsequently confirm the same.

Thus recorded at the office of the secretary of justice of the Castle of Good Hope in the presence of the clerks Pieter Caspar Broedersz and Frederik Wilhelm Allemann, as witnesses, who have signed the original of this together with the deponent and me, the sworn clerk.

Which I declare, \[signed\] L.S. Faber, sworn clerk.

[^1]: Nicolaas Godfried Heijns was a troublesome character. Born in 1725 as the son of a free black woman and a German settler, he was organist of the Cape Town church, but was sacked in 1753 because of his ‘obstinacy’ and ‘insolence’ (Leibbrandt 1905: 253-56). In 1764 he married his second wife Alida Maria de Swart, but they had ‘marriage problems’ and around the time of this incident got separated. It seems as if Heyns lived as a music teacher, but he died indigent. He later played a role in the Patriotten movement of the 1780s (Beyers 1967: 126-28).

[^2]: Flora’s statement is that transcribed here. In addition to what is printed here, the documentation in this case also includes the evidence of Hendrick Heijns, Nicolaas Heijns’s son, and a surgeon’s report on Flora’s wounds, CJ 387, ff. 135-37.

[^3]: The fiscal is referring to legislation which permitted slave-owners to punish their slaves ‘domestically’ but not to maltreat them or cause their death, see *Kaapse Plakkaatboek* I: 36-7 (1658) and II: 149-50 (1731). See Shell 1994: 207-11 on the effectiveness of this, and compare 1707 Jan de Thuilot for another example.
