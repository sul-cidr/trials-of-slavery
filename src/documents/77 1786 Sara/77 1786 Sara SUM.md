This is a tragic case of a slave woman in the Swellendam district who drowned herself with her children, one of whom survived. It is not clear from the details provided why, but her suicide followed the death by drowning of November, a male slave of the same owner. The Swellendam landdrost feared that the episode would lead to an epidemic of slave suicides and proposed that her body be gruesomely displayed to warn others who might be contemplating such an act. It could of course be that Sara had a particular reason for killing herself, related to November’s death.[^1] The case may thus indicate a personal fidelity and anguish at a partner’s death, showing that not all slave relationships entailed conflict and jealousy, as the criminal court records often seem to suggest.

Slave suicides were not infrequent, and often occurred after a slave had committed a crime and faced capture and punishment, but sometimes, as appears here, out of desperation to end a particularly unhappy life. Their corpses were usually displayed in public as a deterrent to others.[^2]
