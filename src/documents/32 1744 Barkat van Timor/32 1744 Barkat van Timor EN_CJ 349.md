# BARKAT VAN TIMOR

**CJ 349** Criminele Process Stukken, 1744, ff. 104-8.

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, Barkat van Timor, bondsman of the former burgher councillor, *Sinjeur* Abraham Cloppenburg, 30 years old at a guess, who, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, confesses it to be true:

That at about ten o’clock at night of Saturday, the 22^nd^ of this month February, his owner came home and first went into the room to his wife, coming out again shortly thereafter when he came to the confessant, who was in the *voorhuijs* where he had set the table,[^1] and asked him why the food was not on the table, to which the confessant replied that it had not yet been ordered by him, *Sinjeur* Cloppenburg. Hereupon his said owner immediately grabbed him by the hair and, after having given him some slaps with his hand in the face, took the confessant to the kitchen, ordering some of his fellow slaves to undress him and to tie him to a ladder standing in the kitchen. Hereupon, these slaves immediately took him in order to tie him up and beat him, while in the meantime he begged his owner for forgiveness. However, as this did not help, the confessant tore himself free from the hands of these slaves, taking at this time out of desperation a knife which was lying on the table in the kitchen, and went with it to his owner, who was also still in the kitchen, being of the intention then to take his[^2] life in order thereby to depart from the world himself, because he could not bear it any longer with his owner. Hereupon he stabbed with the said knife at his aforementioned master, without knowing whether or where he had hit the same, whereupon his owner ran from the kitchen to the *galderij*,[^3] being followed by the cook Julij who closed the kitchen door after him, while the other slaves likewise ran to the back of the yard and also closed the door after them.

So that the confessant then found himself alone in the kitchen and was of mind to flee to the attic, yet, when he came to the ladder he met with the slave Julij who was coming down the ladder from the attic, and since he, Julij, was in the way of the confessant, he gave him two stabs with that very same knife, without knowing whether or where he was hit. Hereupon the confessant immediately went to the attic with the knife in his hand, without knowing if he had wounded anybody else at this time.

That when the confessant got to the attic, after letting the ladder fall down into the kitchen, he immediately blocked off the trap-door with some chests which were in the attic, being of the intention to conceal and defend himself as long as he could, continually putting other chests in the place of those which were being worked away from underneath and also, on several occassions, threw whatever he could lay his hands upon, be it pots, bottles, stones etc., through the window of the attic to the people who had joined the others there at the house.

That after some time, when more and more of the chests on the trap-door were worked away, the confessant held several conversations with the people who were in the kitchen. He saw a European person in a white shirt going to the back yard to speak to the *caffers* who were there, which person also swore at him, for which reason the confessant took a pot and hurled it at the head of the said person.

That with the break of day the confessant saw that somebody, with the help of a ladder which had been set up to the window of the attic from the outside, was hacking at that window with a sharp instrument, without having seen anything more of this person than the arm and the instrument since the confessant stood to the side of the window, whereupon he stabbed two or three times in the direction of this person with a sharp broom handle which he at this time held in his hand, and also felt that this person had been hit by it. After this, the chests, which were still on the trap-door, were again worked away below into the kitchen and, while moreover shots were fired at him by Schipper Kroos – after he had managed to get the confessant in view – from a flat roof from where he could see into the attic,[^4] without however hitting him. Upon which the confessant became anxious, and seeing a bamboo parasol handle from which some things were hanging, he took this stick down and sharpened the one end in order to defend himself with it against those who wished to capture him. Shortly hereupon the confessant saw and heard two openings being knocked through the wall and that another opening into the attic was being made next to the trap-door, for which reason the confessant went to the corner by the chimney, where the openings were being made, holding the knife and the bamboo stick in his hands, at which point he was hit unexpectedly upon his head by a *caffer*, not being sure if this was done with a broadsword. Upon this, he and this *caffer* started struggling with each other (continually holding the knife in his hand, though not knowing whether or not he had wounded the said *caffer*) until yet another *caffer* came there and also took him on, and likewise Schipper Kroos, who came into the attic and hit the confessant on his arm with the pistol he had in his hand, by means of which he was unable to defend himself any longer and thus came into the hands of justice.

Finally, the confessant declares not to know if the knife currently being shown to him is the very same knife with which he injured his owner and fellow slave, yet he says that if there is blood on it, it surely must be the same; further that he is sorry to have committed such a crime, to which he confesses his guilt.

Thus confessed in the Malay language, rendered into Dutch by the second undersigned delegate, the honourable Jan Lourens Bestbier, at the Cape of Good Hope on 24 February 1744 before the honourables D. d’Aillij and J.L. Bestbier, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant and me, the secretary.

Verification

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, Barkat van Timor, slave of the former burgher councillor, *Sinjeur* Abraham Cloppenburg, who, after this, his given deposition, had been read out word by word, and interpreted again into the Malay language by the honourable Lourens Bestbier, declares to fully persist by it, therefore not desiring that anything more be added to or taken from it, and declares all of the above to contain the whole truth.

Thus verified at the Cape of Good Hope on 28 February 1744 before the honourables D. d’Aillij and J.L. Bestbier, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant and me, the secretary.

Which I declare, \[signed\] Jn. Fr. Tiemmendorf, secretary.

Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable fiscal Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, by the former burgher councillor, *Sieur* Abraham Cloppenburg, which is of the following content, namely:

That the testifier got home at about ten o’clock this evening[^5] and asked his wife, who was sitting in the back room reading, if the table had been set, and obtained as answer from her that the table is set in the *voorhuijs* and that a while ago his slave Barkat van Timor had demanded the key of the silver cabinet to this end; to which the testifier replied that this had not been done. He then had the slave Barkat called into the *galderij* asking him why the table had not been set, and received from him, rather insolently, the answer that the table had been set for the *knecht*. Hereupon the testifier became rather angry and told the aforementioned slave Barkat that he better go to the kitchen, at once calling the slave Achilles to get a *sjambok* in order to have the said Barkat chastised in the kitchen for his insolence, and, when he got there, the *sjambok* was brought by the said Achilles, whereupon the slave Barkat shot towards the testifier’s body, which the testifier thought was because he wished to fall down in front of his feet and to beg for forgiveness. Yet, instead of this, the same, with a knife which he held in his hand and which the testifier did not see, stabbed him in the middle of his chest, somewhat to the left-hand side, wounding him at the same time with that knife in his right arm. When the testifier received these wounds, he went from the kitchen to the front, without being able to say what happened further.

There being nothing further to declare, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, while offering to subsequently confirm this, his report, at any time, if so required.

Thus related at the Cape of Good Hope at the residence of the testifier on 22 February 1744 before the honourables D. d’Aillij and J.L. Bestbier, members from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the testifier and me, the secretary.

Verification

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, the former burgher councillor, *Sinjeur* Abraham Cloppenburg, who, after this, his given statement, had been read out word by word, clearly and plainly, declares to fully persist by it, therefore not desiring that anything more will be added to or taken away from it, and declares all of the above to be the whole truth.

Thus verified at the Cape of Good Hope on 28 February 1744 before the honourables D. d’Aillij and J.L. Bestbier, members from the aforementioned Council, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the testifier and me, the secretary.

**CJ 349** Criminele Process Stukken, 1744, ff. 115-16v.

Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, by the *bandiet* Pannaij van Boegies,[^6] of competent age, being of the following contents, namely:

That at about half past ten o’clock on Saturday evening, which was the 22^nd^ of this month February, the testifier, serving as *caffer* of the honourable fiscal, went out with some of his colleagues and their honours’ *geweldiger* to the house of the former burgher councillor, *Sieur* Abraham Cloppenburg, in order to help take prisoner a slave who had injured the said *Sieur* Cloppenburg and who was \[hiding\] in the attic of the kitchen.

That after they had been watching all night long without success, the testifier finally, when day broke on Sunday morning, climbed to the attic with the help of a ladder which had been put up to the window at the outside in order to apprehend the said slave. When he got to the attic, the testifier found the same with a knife in his hand, sitting in the corner by the chimney, looking around him; and, since the testifier was not seen by the same, he went to the aforesaid slave and gave him a sudden blow on the left arm with the stick that he had in his hand. Whereupon the said slave leaped up, grabbed the testifier and started to struggle with him, as a result of which the testifier got a cut on the left-hand side of his neck from the said slave with the knife that he held in his hand; and when this slave was again lifting up his hand in order to stab the testifier for a second time, with him trying to prevent this as far as possible and calling for help, he was freed by his colleagues and, coming down from the attic, immediately had himself bandaged.

There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing to subsequently confirm this, his report, at any time, if so required.

Thus related at the Cape of Good Hope on 24 February 1744 in the presence of the clerks Otto Wilhem Rotenburg and Oloff Christoff Karnspek, as witnesses, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the testifier and me, the secretary.

Verification

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, the *bandiet* Pannaij van Boegies, who, after this, his given statement, had been read out word by word, clearly and plainly, declares to fully persist by it, therefore not desiring that anything more be added to or taken from it, except that when he was struggling with the said slave Barkat, he wrested from him the knife he was holding in his hand and also brought it down from the attic; and declares, in the presence of the aforementioned Barkat, all of the above to be the whole truth.

Thus verified at the Cape of Good Hope on 28 February 1744 before the honourables D. d’Aillij and J.L. Bestbier, members from the aforementioned Council, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the testifier and me, the secretary.

Which I declare, \[signed\] Jn. Fr. Tiemmendorf, secretary.

[^1]: The *voorhuijs* was the main reception and eating room at the front of the house. This house appears to have been a relatively large and wealthy one for the period, with a full-sized *voorhuijs* and front and back rooms.

[^2]: This seems to refer to Cloppenburg. Barkat wanted both to kill his owner and to commit suicide by his actions.

[^3]: In older Cape Town houses this was a connecting passageway between the kitchen and the front rooms. It later became a room behind the *voorhuijs* where the family ate and household chores such as sewing were done. It is not clear in this case what the *galderij* contained.

[^4]: i.e. through the front gable window. Schipper Kroos may have been standing on the flat roof of a building opposite the front of the house. This was probably the attic window through which Barkat threw objects at the crowd gathering in the street, and through which, by means of a ladder, the *caffer* gained entry to the attic.

[^5]: Note that this testimony was taken on 22 February, the same day as the events described. Since Cloppenburg was a senior and well-connected burgher, he doubtless ensured that swift action was taken. The sentence was passed on 12 March.

[^6]: Pannaij is exceptional since, unlike any other *caffer*, something is known about his life before he assumed this position. Having served as slave in Batavia, he was banished for life to Robben Island in 1730 for arson. There he laboured as *bandiet* until 1743 when he became *caffer*, thereby greatly improving his lot (on him, see Groenewald 2005).
