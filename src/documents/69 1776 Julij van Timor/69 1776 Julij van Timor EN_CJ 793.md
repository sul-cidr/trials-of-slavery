# JULIJ VAN TIMOR

**CJ 793** Sententiën, 1771-1776, ff. 270-85.

Since Julij van Boegies, slave of the burgher Johan Hendrik Elers, twenty-six years old at a guess, currently their honours’ prisoner, has voluntarily confessed and since, from the other documents produced in the case, it has appeared evident to the honourable Council of Justice:

That at twelve o’clock on the night of Sunday, the last day of the month March of this year, the prisoner, who was stationed on his owner’s farm, situated at Stellenbosch, proceeded from the slave house, where his usual sleeping place was, through the kitchen door, which was open according to him, into his owner’s house and then into the room in which his said owner was lying asleep with his little *voorzoon*, certainly with the intention to steal, but the prisoner pretends it was only to fetch the keys which were hanging on the wall there. That the prisoner’s owner woke up from hearing some movement, just as if something was being dragged in the room, but kept himself still, until he heard something fall, which he thought was a key, which is when he roused his little son and told to him to light the candle which had been put before the bed, for which reason this child then got up, but when he could not find a candle, the prisoner’s owner, because he had heard some movement at the door, as if somebody was leaving the room, got up himself, and went through the kitchen to the outside, without, however, even though it had been clear moonlight, discovering anything.

That the prisoner’s owner lit a candle and discovered then that the cabinet standing in the room had been opened and that the keys which were kept in it had been taken, as well as that a new felly of a wagon wheel was lying on the ground, whereupon he went from his room to a room outside the house and roused the wagonmaker, by the name of Jan Wagenmakers, who was sleeping there along with one of his other *voorzoons*, by the name of Christoffel Tafel, and called him into the house to tell him about what had happened, which is when they thought it good to both go to the slave house in order to find out if the slave Eva, who had made up the bed of the aforesaid Elers, knew anything of the case, or might even have been involved with it, but since they did not discover anything after a proper investigation; and the prisoner, whom they did not suspect at all, was lying on his bed as if he were asleep, the aforesaid Wagenmakers returned to his sleeping place and the prisoner’s owner to his bedroom and again lay themselves down to sleep.

That about half an hour after this, when the prisoner’s owner heard some noise outside the house as if somebody was beating on a washing tub standing there and then ran around the house, he again got up from bed and went outside, but without having perceived anybody, wherefore he returned to his room again and lay down to sleep. However, a short while thereafter, when he heard a heavy blow on the front door, just as if this door was being beaten in, he again went to the outside and called loudly before the door: “Who is there?”, without however receiving any answer, nor having seen anybody, whereupon the said Elers returned and locked the door.

After about a quarter of an hour had passed, when the prisoner’s owner heard, just as before, somebody beating upon the door, he asked: “Who is there?”, and then received as answer, accompanied by an indecent expression: “Open up!”, to which the prisoner’s owner again asked: “Who are you then?”, whereupon he was answered: “Son of a bitch, open up!”, which is when the aforementioned Elers called to his children: “Take a musket and shoot him so that the smoke comes from his throat!”, without then hearing anything else being mentioned, as before.

That in the meantime, the aforesaid Wagenmaker, as well as the said Christoffel Tafel, woke up from hearing these heavy blows, both of them got up, when the said Tafel went outside the door first and up to the corner of that building when the prisoner, who was walking away from his owner’s house, came towards this young man there and, while saying: “Have you also come to look at me!”, gave him a stab in the chest, with an *assegaaij* he was holding in his hands, which, even though this youth was only wearing a nightshirt, did not penetrate as this *assegaaij* was blunt, but only caused a scrape on his skin and since, at that moment, the aforesaid Jan Wagenmakers – who, thinking that there might have been runaway slaves on the farm, had picked up a pitchfork – also came outside, when the said Tafel, while the prisoner was running towards this man \[Wagenmakers\], called to him: “Beware, it is little Julij,[^1] who has an *assegaaij* in his hands, and who has stabbed at me with it!”

That the wagonmaker then asked the prisoner: “Julij! what have you done at the house of the *baas*?”, whereupon the prisoner, while saying: “Have you also come to look at me?”, stabbed three or four times with the *assegaaij* at this man – although only one of these stabs penetrated through the sleeves of the jacket he was wearing – even though the same defended himself with the pitchfork he held in his hands and also shoved the prisoner two or three times to the ground, yet the prisoner got up from the ground every time and then started to run away and saved himself thus with fleeing into the veld. On the following morning, they found the prisoner’s knife, still in its sheath, on the ground at the place where the prisoner had stabbed at the aforementioned Tafel with the *assegaaij* and, later on, the keys missing from the cabinet above the prisoner’s bed amongst the wood piled on top of the beams there. In the meantime, the prisoner had set out to the Cape where he, after having roamed around for a couple of days, was taken prisoner on the beach by a servant of justice, and thus was taken into arrest.[^2]

Now, although the prisoner did not at all want to confess during the judicial enquiry that it was with the intention to steal that he had gone into his owner’s house and room, and opened the cabinet, but stubbornly continued to persist in his denial; he was, however, judicially convinced of this, as also of his other evil intentions and the malicious deeds he perpetrated, in such a manner that he in no ways can escape his well-deserved punishment, but should be punished as an example and deterrent to other such malefactors, in order to protect the good inhabitants of the rural areas.

Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, serving today, having read and considered with care the written *crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie*, drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoner by the landdrost of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, *Sieur* Marthinus Adrianus Bergh, in his official capacity, as well as having noted the prisoner’s voluntary confession, and the other documents added to it, all properly verified in court, further everything else that served the case and could possibly have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf the high and mighty Lords States General of the United Netherlands, and having judged the prisoner Julij van Boegies, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the place where criminal sentences are usually executed here, there to be handed over to the executioner, to be exposed with the rope around his neck on one of the posts of the gallows, further to be tied to a stake and be severely scourged with rods on his bare back, thereupon to be branded, then to be riveted in chains, in which to labour on the public works on Robben Island for the remainder of his life, with sentencing to the costs and expenditure of justice.[^3]

Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on the first of August 1776, as also pronounced and executed on the tenth thereupon.

Let the execution be done, \[signed\] Jm. van Plettenburg.

[^1]: This must have been a literal reference to Julij’s shortness, since he was 26 years old.

[^2]: On the night before he was taken prisoner, Julij went to the house of his previous owner, Coenraad Eb, in Cape Town and told one of the slaves there that he had done *quaad* (literally ‘evil’ or ‘bad’) on his owner’s farm and had stabbed the *knecht* and the son of his owner. He added, however, that he did not mean to harm them, but wanted only to have hurt his *baas*, CJ 410, ff. 296-97, testimony of Johan Ehlers, 13 May 1776.

[^3]: This was the sentence called for in the *eijsch* and it was recorded in the *regtsrollen* on 1 August, CJ 58, ff. 24-5. It is not clear why it was not executed until 10 August, since punishments were usually administered within two days of sentencing.
