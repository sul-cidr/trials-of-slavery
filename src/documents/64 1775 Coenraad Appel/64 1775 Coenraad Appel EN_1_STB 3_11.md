# COENRAAD APPEL

**1/STB 3/11** Criminele Verklaringen, 1759-1782, unpaginated.

Today, 25 January 1775, there appears before me, Abraham Faure, secretary of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the slave October van Bougies, of competent age, belonging to the farmer Coenraad Appel, who, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Marthinus Adrianus Bergh, declares it to be true:

That in the afternoon at about 3 o’clock, some time ago now, without being able to specify when, when the deponent was busy working alone in the garden, his *nonje* Elsie went with a kettle in her hand to fetch water at the fountain situated there, while his owner, who was somewhat inebriated, shortly thereupon followed her and when they both got beneath a fig tree standing by this fountain, the said *nonje* Elsie lay down on the ground there, his *baas* then lifted up her skirts and did his business (as the deponent expresses himself) with her. After which the deponent, who had seen this clearly, again betook himself to his work.

There being nothing further to relate, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing, if so required, to subsequently confirm the above.

Thus recorded at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch, in the presence of the messenger of the court Morits Herman Otto Woeke and the burgher Johannes Victor, as witnesses.

This mark X was set down by the slave October with his own hand.

Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Marthinus Adrianus Bergh, by the slave Filida van de Caab, of competent age, belonging to the farmer Coenraad Appel, which is of the following content, namely:

That on a certain Sunday after sunset, some time ago now, without being able to specify when, when her owner again sent his daughter, or his wife’s oldest daughter, by the name of Elsie Anna, to the fountain to fetch water – after she had already brought two buckets of water into the house from the fountain and he had immediately poured out one of the same – he instantly followed her. That shortly thereupon, the testifier also went thither to scoop a can of water for herself and when she got behind a fig tree standing there, she saw from close by that her owner was lying on the naked body of *nonje* Elsie under the said tree and that he was using her carnally. That in the morning of the following day, the testifier reproached the said Elsie over this and asked her if she fully realised what evil she had committed with her father, and told her that she had seen it; that Elsie answered to this: “Yes, I know it very well, but what should I do! He forces me to it, and when it comes out and I am asked about it, I will tell everything and will conceal nothing”.

That some days thereafter, during the evening when it was already getting dark, and when the owner of the testifier, being somewhat inebriated, went to lie behind the old cellar, he ordered the aforementioned Elsie to bring him a small bowl of water, which she also did, while the testifier went to stand there to see what they would do, and that she then discovered that he took said Elsie by her skirts and pulled her to him, whereupon the said Elsie addressed him: “Father! Mother would surely see this”, and he answered: “What the hell do I care about your mother?”, she Elsie then at once went to lie with him on the ground, and he then lay on top of her and, as the testifier could espy, had carnal knowledge of her, after which the testifier went in silence to the slaves’ room.

Moreover, that at sunset on a certain day some time thereafter, which the testifier is unable to specify, when her owner had sent the aforementioned *nonje* Elsie beyond the so-called Schilpadden Valleij to bring back the horses, he immediately followed her thither, after which the deponent went to the veld to collect wood and, when she got to the said valley, she saw them both lying together in some bushes in the same way as previously mentioned; as well as later, on a certain day by eventide, when the aforementioned Elsie was sent by her said father to drive the pigs to the aforesaid valley and he, as before, followed her; the testifier, who once again had gone in that direction to collect wood, saw that they were both, as before, lying on top of each other in some bushes.

There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of her statement as in the text, being willing, if so required, to subsequently confirm the above.

Thus related at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch on 25 January 1775 in the presence of the messenger of the court Morits Herman Otto Woeke and the burgher Johannes Victor, as witnesses.

This X mark was set down by Filida van de Caab with her own hand.

Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Marthinus Adrianus Bergh, by Elsie Anna Meijburgh, wife of the farmer Coenraad Appel, which is of the following content, namely:

That in the year 1755, when the testifier entered into matrimony with her aforementioned husband Coenraad Appel, she was already pregnant by another man with her daughter Elsie Anna, who was also born some time before the celebration of their marriage.

That for some considerable time now, the daughter she brought with her \[into the marriage\] often got beaten by the testifier’s husband, although she never said any insolent words to him over this, but patiently endured it without any protest. Yet that Elsie displayed the opposite \[response\] with regards to the testifier, and often treated her harshly and disrespectfully, even in the presence of her husband, and that he always let this pass in silence; which grieved the testifier continually, without, however, having conceived any malicious suspicion regarding her husband and daughter.

That, by the testifier’s estimate, about four months ago now, when she had scolded her said daughter Elsie in the kitchen, and the same then addressed her very harshly and insolently, the slave Filida reproached her for it with these words: “For shame! Do you have to treat your mother like this, you treat her like a dog, she has to endure everything from you”, with an additional reproof: “For shame! That you dare to do such ungodly things with your father!” Whereupon Elsie answered: “How could I help it?” The testifier, who had listened to this with amazement, then said to her said daughter: “These are nice things, Elsie, that I hear of you!”, whereupon Elsie again answered: “Could I help it?” Upon which the aforementioned Filida continued: “If you had been a virtuous daughter, you would not have done such a thing, but would immediately have warned your mother of it”. That, on a certain day thereafter, when the testifier, who could not actually believe this of her husband, questioned the said Elsie alone behind the house about that over which she was reproached by the aforementioned slave, she denied it with this expression: “For shame! How could mother think that! Would father do such a thing to me?” While adding further to the question of how the *meijd* could then have reproached her for it: “She does reproach me for it, yes, but she did not see it, and will have to make amends for it”.

That some days later, when the testifier was strolling alone with her said daughter Elsie on the road and again brought up the aforesaid and questioned her, Elsie then related what she had done with the husband of the testifier in all its circumstances, without, however, having added that she had been forced to it. For which reason the testifier no longer had any doubts over this matter.

That on a certain afternoon, when the aforesaid slave was out to fetch wood and the testifier’s husband had ordered the aforementioned Elsie to boil water for tea, the testifier was told by her husband to go out and pick some figs at the fountain, whither she went, yet, when she came back into the house after a quarter of an hour, she found her husband sleeping on the bed, while her daughter was busy sweeping the house; without the testifier having then discovered anything else.

That about a month ago, during the evening, when her husband had beaten the slaves October and Louis in the yard and thereupon came into the house with a stick in his hand, he dealt the slave Filida a blow on her head, saying to her: “You are the schemer of all the slaves”, whereupon he went into the room; while the testifier, who was still sitting at the tea-table, heard the said Filida saying: “There are still lords to whom I can go to complain, and I will incite the other *jongens* to it”; the said Filida, together with the slaves October, Louis and Caesar, then also departed from there that same night.

Finally, the testifier declares that, after she had learned about that which had been committed by her aforementioned husband with her daughter, she talked to him about it on one or two occasions, when he denied it every time. Yet that he, shortly before his departure, confessed this to her while showing remorse.

There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of her statement as in the text, being willing, if so required, to subsequently confirm the above with solemn oaths.

Thus related at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch on 7 February 1775 in the presence of the burgher Johannes Victor and the soldier Johan Jacob Frederik Wagener, as witnesses.
