# JANUARIJ VAN TUTOCORIJN

**CJ 341** Criminele Process Stukken, 1737, ff. 397-98.

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, Januarij van Tutocorijn, slave of the widow of Melt van der Spuij, 20 years old at a guess, who, on requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, *Meester* Daniel van den Henghel, confesses it to be true:

That more than a few days ago, without being able to tell the correct date, the confessant, returning home in the evening without having been able to earn *koeli geld*, was miserably beaten by his owner and afterwards sent out, without getting his meal, to earn his *koeli geld*. However, since he was beaten and starving, he secretly crawled into the house of the burgher Nicolaas Cochelius, and, after having taken there a piece of bread and eaten it, went to the attic and, having obtained there from the others a blanket with some bedding, then lay down to rest since he did not dare to return home. During the night he was roused by a *jongen* and a *meijd* of the house, and delivered into the hands of justice.

Thus confessed at the Cape of Good Hope on 2 September 1737 before the honourables J. T. Rhenius and Jan de Wit, members of the aforementioned honourable Council of Justice, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant and me, the secretary.

Verification

There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, the slave Januarij van Tutocorijn, who, after this, his given confession, had been read out word by word, clearly and plainly, declares to fully persist with it, therefore having no desire that anything further be added to or taken from it.

Thus verified at the Cape of Good Hope on 4 September 1737 in the Dutch language, which the confessant speaks and understands reasonably well, before the honourables J.T. Rhenius and Jan de Wit, members from the aforementioned honourable Council, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant and me, the secretary.

Which I declare, \[signed\] Js. de Grandpreez, secretary.

*Dictum ter rolle*

Honourable Lord and Lords,

To prove this *dictum* with a few words, the *eijsscher* only produces the verified confession of the defendant, from which it would come to appear to your honours:

How in the evening, some days ago, the prisoner went, according to what he says, to his owner’s house without being able to bring with him his appointed *koeli geld*. Because he did not bring in this said money, he was at once beaten miserably by his owner, the widow Van der Spuij, and afterwards was sent out at once, without his meal, in order to find that money. Yet, as he says, being so miserably beaten and starved, and therefore incapable of looking for *coeli* \[*sic*\], he secretly sneaked into the house of the burgher Nicolaas Cochelius during the evening, stealing and eating there the bread that he found, and quietly went upstairs to the attic and, covering himself with a blanket, lay down to sleep, since he did not dare go home. However, surely because he made a noise in the night and was discovered by the slaves of the house, he was brought, on the order of the said burgher Cochelius, to the prison at four o’clock in the morning, together with a blanket and some old pillows which were lying by and on top of his body. And even though this rogue now denies having stolen anything in the house, or having sneaked into that house with wicked intent, and brings as excuse that he gets lots of beatings and little to eat from his owner; this business is nevertheless of many evil consequences – and is even more punishable in this crook, as he has now been caught in this fashion at night for the third time already, then in this one’s and then in that one’s house – because nobody could be imagined sneaking like this into another man’s house at night and remaining there, and it not being to an evil end, namely to either steal, murder, or even to commit arson. Apart from this, if the master of a house would find an unknown black *jongen* at night in his house, he could, and totally in accordance with the law, stab to death or shoot the same; above and beyond that, such a crook could cause fatal trouble and disturbance to the woman and children in houses where there is no man in the house. Therefore, a case which is dangerous in every way and therefore punishable.

Now, whether the excuse of this *jongen* – namely that he was continually being beaten by his owner when he did not produce his appointed *koeli geld*, and besides got very little to eat – could give rise to any remission, the *eijsscher* wants to leave solely to the judgment of your honours, adding only to it that all of the *jongens* who had been brought to prison of the said woman, sing the same lamentations to the *eijsscher*; however, whatever the truth of that may be, this crook is nevertheless punishable.

Which is why the *eijsscher*, to check all similar nightly visitations and to prevent all accidents which could come as a result of it, presumes with good reason to demand, as he does with this:

Demanding that the prisoner and defendant mentioned in the heading of this, with certain judgment by your honours, be sentenced to be tied to a stake, to be severely whipped by the *caffers*, and further to be riveted in chains, in which to serve for nothing on the honourable Company’s public works for a period of 18 successive months, with the costs, or to any similar end as your honours deem fitting.[^1]

Exhibit in court, 12 September 1737.

\[signed\] D. van den Henghel.
