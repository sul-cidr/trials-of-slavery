This letter from the Stellenbosch landdrost to the Council of Justice concerned the suicide of a male slave who had attacked a female slave on the same farm because he suspected her of infidelity. It is revealing not only for the emotional bonds between slaves and the use of what today would be described as domestic violence, but also for the ways in which a suicide case was dealt with by the local authorities. They were primarily concerned with the fact that they could not find a tree or beam from which to hang Andries’s corpse. The bodies of slaves who had committed suicide were supposed to be publicly displayed in this way as a warning to others.[^1]

On the way in which the corpses of suicide victims were treated, and the differences in the ‘punishments’ given to those of Khoi and slaves, and those of people of European origin, see Upham 2001a.
