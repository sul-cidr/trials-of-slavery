# ANDRIES VAN BENGALEN

**CJ 2485** Inkoomende Brieven, 1729-1759, Deel 1, ff. 52-4.

The Cape of Good Hope.

To the honourable lord Rijk Tulbagh, *opperkoopman* and *secunde[^1] * of this government, and also the president of the honourable Council of Justice.

Honourable Lord!

Bound by duty, we hereby inform your honour that yesterday, in the late afternoon, the undersigned landdrost was informed that a certain slave, by name of Andries van Bengale, belonging to the lieutenant Johannes Louw Jacobsz, wounded a *meijd* named Romana van de Caab, bondswoman of the widow of Philip Morkel, who resides with the said Louw on his farm, situated in Drakenstein, known as Kuilenburg, and that he thereafter also wounded himself with a knife. Upon which we, with the secretary, doctor and messenger, set out immediately to that place, where we found, on investigation, that on the 4^th^ of this month, late in the afternoon, while his master was not at home and his mistress had gone into the garden, the said *jongen* Andries (who had a relationship with the aforementioned *meijd* Romana) came from the kitchen into the *voorhuijs*, and grabbed by the hair the said *meijd* Romana, who was sitting there with two to three other *meijden* doing sewing.[^2] He then, out of jealousy, as we have learned, gave her throat a cut with the knife he held in his hand, saying: “Whore! Why are you doing this to me?” The *meijd* then grabbed the knife with her right hand, from which she received a big wound on her hand, but holding it nonetheless firmly, and threw it into the kitchen on the floor. In the meantime, the aforementioned slave Andries took a rice pestle, with which he dealt the said Romana, after missing the first time, a sidelong blow on her neck the second time, upon which she fled from the house.

That the slave women who were sitting and doing their sewing with the aforesaid Romana, all took flight when they saw the slave Andries grabbing the *meijd* Romana by her hair and cutting into her throat, and went to their mistress in the garden to whom they made this known. The same immediately called some of the slave men, who were working in the garden, to her and gave them orders to catch the slave Andries and to tie him up, lest and before more evil would be done. Yet, coming into the house and looking through a window to the outside, she immediately noticed Andries lying some paces away on the ground of the yard in front of the house, being very bloody and with his entrails hanging from his body. Understanding from her slaves that this *jongen* was dead, she immediately sent somebody to call her husband, who had gone out riding, who, coming home and seeing that there was still some life in this *jongen*, had the undersigned landdrost informed.

The cut which the slave Andries had given himself goes across his whole abdomen, through the entrails and the stomach, and was therefore fatal; however, the doctor testifies that the wounds of the slave woman Romana are not dangerous.

At our arrival there was still some life left in the aforesaid slave Andries, but, while we were in the house to inform ourselves about this case, and specifically whether it was Romana or this *jongen* who cut open his abdomen, he died. And since there are no trees around here, and since no timber work can be had from which to hang him by his legs,[^3] we were obliged, on the request of the said Louw, to have this *jongen* dragged by his legs from the yard to the veld; hoping that these, our actions, will be favourably approved by your honour.

With which we commend your honour’s beloved person and honourable family into the protection of the Almighty God, and declare to always remain with the utmost respect:

Honourable Lord!

Your honour’s obedient and faithful servants,

Kuijlenburgh, 6 September 1741.

[^1]: .Literally ‘second person’. This was the title of the deputy governor. Tulbagh assumed this office in 1739.

[^2]: This case illustrates the gendered nature of slave labour on the farm: while the male slaves were working outside in the garden, the women were inside the house doing sewing. On the use of slave women for needlework, see Shell 1994: 51-2 and 161. Unlike the plantation slave societies of the Americas, female slaves at the Cape did not usually do regular field work, although there were exceptions, especially during the harvesting season (Worden 1985: 21 and 88).

[^3]: This was the usual punishment for slave suicides, though other ones were also known. For mention of this case in this regard, see De Kock 1950: 184.
