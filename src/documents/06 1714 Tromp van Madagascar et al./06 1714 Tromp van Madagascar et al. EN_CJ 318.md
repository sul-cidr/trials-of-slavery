Answer: That he had done this because he was being chased by a certain Dutchman who asked him whose *jongen* he was, to which the prisoner answered that he was the slave of Christoffel Esterhuijs, whereupon this Dutchman drove him on in front of the horse, but the prisoner could not continue any longer, when he found a knife near some shrub, with which he cut himself in the throat.

Thus done and verified in the Castle of Good Hope on 20 January 1714.

[^1]: The subject of this is unstated in the Dutch. It appears that others were present at the interrogation (compare article 21) who may have spoken up against him. It is equally possible that the fiscal meant: ‘*We* are convinced or persuaded by the testimonies of Jonas...’.

[^2]: Schoeman (2002b: 9-10) suggests that it is possible that this Claas Kok was the progenitor of the later Griqua captains. Certainly, Adam Kok, usually considered the founder of the Griquas, first entered the historical record during the 1750s when he was farming in the region of Piketberg, the area where this case was set, and his descendants later claimed that he was born the son of a slave.

[^3]: This is probably the *Ricinus communis*, known as the *kasterolieboom*, and in the eighteenth century often simply called *olieboom*, and of which both the oil and leaves were used as medicines (Thunberg 1986: xl-xli, 56 and Scholtz 1972: 148).
