# MENTOR VAN MOSAMBIQUE

*A fight broke out between Mentor and the burgher Tielman Roos because Mentor refused to greet Tielman, saying he was only obliged to greet his owner and wife. This episode is a rare example of verbal resistance by slaves, although it also led to physical conflict.[^1] It also illustrates the importance attached to symbolic acts in the maintenance of social distinctions between masters and servants.[^2] It appears as if no further action was taken.[^3]*

[^1]: For a similar example of the refusal of a slave to greet a burgher, see 1794 Abraham van Macassar.

[^2]: This was equally the case in early modern Europe where status was clearly displayed through symbolic and ritual acts (Muir 1997), but was particularly marked in a colonial slave society (Ross 1999).

[^3]: The case was not sent to the Council of Justice, and there is no record of further action by the Stellenbosch authorities.
