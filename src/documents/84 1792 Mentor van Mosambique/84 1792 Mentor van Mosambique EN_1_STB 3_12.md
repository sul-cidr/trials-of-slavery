Statement, given in the presence of the undersigned deputised *heemraden*, the honourables Johan Bernhard Hoffman and Pieter Gerhard Wium, and on requisition of the landdrost of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, the honourable Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, by the burgher Tieleman Roos Jansz, of competent age, which goes as follows:

That yesterday afternoon, when the testifier, who lives with his uncle, the burgher Francois Roos, was going from the house to the fields, he found the slave Mentor van Mosambique,[^1] belonging to the burgher Stephanus Francois Joubert, about 100 paces from the house, and to whom the testifier said in essence: “Good day, *jongen*”, while the same did not want to greet him, whereupon the testifier asked him if he, Mentor, did not greet a Christian?[^2] which the slave answered by saying no, because he was not obliged to greet the testifier but only his owner and mistress. That, because of the insolent behaviour of this slave, the testifier dealt him a blow with the light *kirrij* he had in his hands, upon which the slave immediately seized the testifier by the throat, while the testifier also took hold of the said slave’s throat with both his hands in order to free himself, and then gave the said slave Mentor a blow in the face with his one hand, as a result of which the testifier got free from him.

That after this, the aforementioned slave Mentor tried to take up one end of a bamboo stick, that the testifier tried to beat him to it, which is when the aforementioned slave pushed the testifier away and lifted up the end of the bamboo stick. The testifier was then given a blow on his head, causing his hat to fall off, by him, Mentor,[^3] who tried to retreat backwards; and while the testifier was following this slave, the same tried to give him yet another blow, which the testifier evaded, though, by jumping sideways.

That the testifier then took hold of the aforementioned slave Mentor with the intention of taking him prisoner, during which the burgher Pieter de Villiers came by and also helped the testifier to hold down the aforesaid slave Mentor. Yet the said slave managed to draw away and then grabbed the testifier by his left leg, which is when the testifier gave Mentor a blow in the face so that his nose and mouth bled, who then let him go. Upon this, the aforementioned slave Mentor repaired to the farm of his owner, situated nearby.

The testifier finally declares that when the aforementioned Mentor had grabbed him by the throat, he said: “If only I had my knife with me”.

There being nothing further to relate, the testifier declares to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being prepared to subsequently confirm the same solemnly.

Thus recorded at the secretary’s office at Stellenbosch on 22 November 1792.

[^1]: This toponym, used to refer to slaves imported from the south-east African coast and its hinterland, began to replace the earlier form ‘Rio de la Goa’ in the later eighteenth century. The former VOC station at Rio de la Goa (Delagoa Bay, or modern Maputo) was closed down in 1732, but in the later eighteenth century increasing numbers of slaves were brought to the Cape by French, American and Dutch traders from the region and its hinterland, and were called ‘van Mozambique’; Shell 2001; Reidy 1997: 18-22; and Worden 2002b: 132-33 for figures.

[^2]: The word in the original is almost illegible – the most likely possibility is *Christ*, an abbreviation for *Christen*. In the course of the eighteenth century this word came to refer specifically to white people (see examples in Scholtz 1972: 117-18), although the question of whether the oppositional terms ‘christian’and ‘heathen’ were completely co-terminous with racial identities during this period is somewhat controversial (see Newton-King 1999: 1-2 and Biewenga 1999: 276-78). What is clear is that Roos was upset here because a slave did not answer him, a colonist.

[^3]: The meaning of this sentence is very opaque. The translation presumes that the word ‘door’ was left out before ‘hem Mentor’.
