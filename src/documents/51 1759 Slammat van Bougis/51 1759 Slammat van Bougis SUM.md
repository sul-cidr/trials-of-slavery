# SLAMMAT VAN BOUGIS

*This is a rare example of a slave who answers back when told to get on with his work.[^1] When his owner tried to hit him with a spade, Slammat attacked him. Slammat now had nothing to lose, and set fire to his ownerâ€™s house and workplace before fleeing with a gun. Arson was a relatively common means by which slaves got their own back on their owners by destroying their property.[^2] Slammat was not captured and so we have no record of what happened to him.[^3]*

[^3]: This is the only testimony collected by the landdrost of Stellenbosch, and since Slammat had run away, the case was not sent to the Council of Justice.
