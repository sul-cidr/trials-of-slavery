Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Marthinus Adrianus Bergh, by the slave Julij van de Caab, of competent age, bondsman of the burgher Jacobus Malan, which is of the following content, namely:

That on a Sunday evening, some time ago now, without the testifier being able to specify when, when his owner was at the Cape and the mistress had already gone to bed, while the testifier, as also the women slaves Cadace and Dina, as well as the testifier’s little son Februarij, were in the kitchen on their owner’s farm, the said Februarij ridiculed and laughed at the slave Cadace because of her speaking broken Dutch,[^1] over which the testifier punished him and gave him two clouts on the ears. The *knecht*, Michiel Radijn, who was there, intervened, asking the testifier why he was beating this little *jongen* and the testifier answered: “Because he was naughty and ridiculed the old folk”, while adding: “I may beat him, he is my son, even if my *baas* were present, he would even have said: ‘Hit him!’” Thereupon, when the testifier turned himself around, he received such a blow against his head from the back that he suddenly fell down and remained lying senseless like this, until he was picked up by the *meijden* and taken into a room next to the kitchen, which is when he again came to, but was still unaware of how this blow was given to him or with what; of which, as well as his transport to the aforesaid room, the testifier was eventually informed by aforementioned Dina and Cadace.[^2]

There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing, if so required, to subsequently confirm the above.

Thus related at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch on 18 August 1774 in the presence of the messenger of the court Morits Herman Otto Woeke and the soldier Frederik Wagener, as witnesses.

This mark X was set down by the slave Julij with his own hand.

[^1]: It is intriguing that in this case all the slaves mentioned are ‘van de Caab’ and seemingly conversing in a form of Dutch with one another, and not making use of one of the contact languages common amongst slaves at the Cape during this time (see 1775 Moses van Bengalen). This may be indicative of the fact that more and more slaves were locally born at the Cape by this stage (although full creolisation did not take place until the nineteenth century). But even though Candace seems to have grown up at the Cape, she still does not pronounce Dutch ‘correctly’, at least in the eyes of the young boy (according to her testimony, he teased her every time ‘onder het spreeken van een Duits woord door haar niet wel uitgebragt’ \[when she said a Dutch word not well pronounced by her\], 1/STB 3/11, testimony of Candace van de Caab, 2 August 1774, unpaginated). This may reflect something of the nature of the variety of Dutch used by Cape-born slaves, although very little is known about this topic.

[^2]: It was of course Radijn who had hit him from behind with a piece of firewood, as reported in the testimonies of both Dina van de Caab and Candace van de Caab, 1/STB 3/11, 2 August 1774, unpaginated, the only other documentation for this case.
