# MICHIEL RADIJN

*This dispute between a slave and a* knecht *reveals the ways in which slaves could be denied any authority, including that over their own children.[^1] Julij van de Caab was hit by the* knecht *Michiel Radijn for giving his own son a boxing on the ears. He argued that his owner (who was away at the time) would have approved. Radijn resented this challenge to his control over the farm’s slaves in his employer’s absence.[^2]*

*The limiting of a slave father’s ability to care for or to control his own children was a cause of resentment and resistance in a number of recorded cases. Male slaves could not be ‘masters’ of their own families and were so prevented from developing the gendered role which was customary for other fathers at the time.[^3]*

[^1]: Radijn was presumably investigated by the Stellenbosch landdrost for assault, but there is no record that he was punished and the case was not forwarded to the Council of Justice. The case strikingly demonstrates the lack of *potestas* (legal authority or power) that slaves had over their own children. These were instead the possessions of their owners (De Kock 1950: 114; Botha 1962, vol. II: 171-72; and Schoeman 2001: 583-84).

[^2]: See 1761 Johan Spring in ’t Veld, n. 1 for a discussion of the role of *knechten* on farms.

[^3]: For example, 1749 Reijnier van Madagascar, who attacked his owners and ran away when his daughter was whipped by them. One of the causes of resentment by Galant van de Caab, who led the Bokkeveld uprising in 1825, was that he was forbidden to discipline his own child. Van der Spuy (1996) argues that this challenge to his masculinity was one of the gendered aspects of the revolt.
