# DAVID VAN BENGALEN

*The landdrost of the newly created eastern pastoral district of Swellendam here tells the Council of Justice that a slave had reported that his owner, Jan Lodewijk Bouwer, had beaten the slave Alexander van Mallebaar, causing his death. Investigation of the corpse did not reveal such lethal blows, although Bouwer admitted beating him and made excuses for not reporting Alexander’s later death. The evidence was inconclusive, but David van Bengalen was whipped for making a false accusation.[^1]*

*Although by law owners had to report the deaths of their slaves, and the authorities investigated cases of suspected maltreatment, there were limits to the protection that this gave to slaves, especially on a remote farm such as this one.* [^2] *David van Bengalen’s punishment and return to his owner would hardly have encouraged other slaves to bring complaints against their owners.*

[^1]: David’s complaint and the surgeon’s report accompanied the letter, CJ 2485, ff. 121-2 and 126. He was punished by the local authorities and the case did not come before the Council of Justice.
