Report to the right honourable lord Rijk Tulbagh, nominated[^1] governor of the Cape of

Good Hope and the areas falling under its control etc., drawn up by the undersigned, Jan Andries Horak, as landdrost of Swellendam, concerning the case, reported to him, of a malicious beating to death, allegedly done by the burgher Jan Lodewijk Bouwer to his slave *jongen*, named Alexander van Mallebaar:

Right honourable lord,

On the 4^th^ of this current month October, it was reported to me, the undersigned, by the slave David van Bengalen, bondsman of the burgher and inhabitant Jan Lodk. Bouwer, that the aforementioned Jan Lodk. Bouwer had beaten another slave *jongen* belonging to him with a stick in such a way that he had come to die of it.

Thus, bound by duty, I found myself compelled to set out with two *heemraden*, to the farm of the said Jan Lodewijk Bouwer, by the name of the Klipfonteijn, situated at the Dunes, in order to closely investigate this case.

Having arrived there on 7 October following, I, the undersigned, asked Jan Lodk. Bouwer whether he had beaten one of his slave *jongens* to death or in which way he had come to die, as well as why he, Jan Lodk. Bouwer, had not, as is the custom of the land, informed me of it before he had interred the corpse; to which the aforementioned J.L. Bouwer in essence answered thus:

That on 11 September preceding, his shepherd, by the name of Alexander, while running up and down, was given some lashes in the cattle corral by him, J.L. Bouwer, with a cane – which he showed us – for the loss of a certain number of sheep.

That the aforementioned Alexander thereupon looked after the sheep for three more days, or until 14 September, and, coming home on the last evening, complained of being ill. Further, that he came to die on 25 September following.

That he, Jn. Lk. Bouwer, on the following day had let the *heemraad* Daniel Leroe \[*sic*\] know of the death of his slave, since he could not come to the undersigned to bring this to his attention, seeing that the rivers were high and that his wife and some children were unwell, being therefore forced to inter the corpse on 27 September, after having the same examined by the burghers Jacobus van Beelen and Anthonij Minie.

Wherefore the undersigned, in the presence of the *heemraden*, had the aforesaid dead body exhumed once again and inspected by the soldier Fredrik Sigismind \[*sic*\] Moodeman (since he knows the art of surgery), but without being able to find any wounds or blows which could have caused death to be the result, as can also be gleaned from the testimony of the *heemraden*, attached herewith.

Which is why the undersigned, being of the opinion that no case can be found for or against the aforementioned Jan Lodewijk Bouwer, has to relieve him of any further procedures; thinking it further right that the aforementioned slave David be severely whipped for falsely accusing his master and then be sent back to his owner’s home.

Thinking herewith to have done the necessary in his official capacity, this serves as a humble report, while I undersign myself obediently,

Right honourable lord,

Your right honour’s humble and obedient servant,

\[signed\] J.A. Horak.

Swellendam, 11 October 1750.

[^1]: This report was written in October 1750. When Swellengrebel announced in 1749 that he wished to step down as governor, the Council of Policy suggested Tulbagh as his successor to the Heren XVII. However, Tulbagh officially took over from Swellengrebel only in February 1751, probably the time it took for the answer from the Heren XVII to arrive, DSAB II: 726. This may explain the use of ‘nominated’ here, indicating that Tulbagh had been proposed, but not yet confirmed, as governor.
