This is a case of a dispute which broke out on a farm when the owner and his wife were away. Gerrit Hartog also lived on the farm[^1] and accused the slave Juliana van de Caab of being insolent and inattentive when serving him food. His subsequent physical attack on her led to her miscarriage. There was also a *knecht* present, and the incident reveals that slaves were subject to the authority – and abuse – of other settlers apart from their owners, perhaps in this case because their owners were absent.[^2]

[^1]: The *opgaaf* for Hercules Adrian Malan for 1769 records that he owned twelve adult male, two adult female and one boy slaves on his mixed wine, cattle, sheep and grain farm (J 173, Stellenbosch district, f. 8). Gerrit Hartog was listed separately in the same *opgaaf* as having only a horse, and was seemingly without a farm of his own, although it is not clear in what capacity he was living on the Malan farm (J 173, Stellenbosch district, f. 2). There is no record of a *knecht* on the Malan farm in the *opgaaf* and he might have been a *bijwoner*.

[^2]: The case does not appear in the records of the Council of Justice for 1769 (CJ 51 and CJ 396) and so was evidently not considered important enough to be sent to Cape Town.
