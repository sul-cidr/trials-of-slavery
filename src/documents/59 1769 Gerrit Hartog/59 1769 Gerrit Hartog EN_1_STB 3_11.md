# GERRIT HARTOG

**1/STB 3/11** Criminele Verklaringen, 1759-1782, unpaginated.

Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Lucas Sigimundus Faber, by the slave Juliana van de Caab, of competent age, belonging to the *heemraad*, *Monsieur* Hercules Adriaan Malan, of the following content, namely:

That on Friday the 14^th^ of this month, when the testifier’s owner and wife had ridden off, the burgher Gerrit Hartog, who lives on the farm, ordered the testifier to set the table, which she did, and when she served the food, the said Hartog asked her if she had brought the eggs into the house, whereupon the testifier answered that there were no eggs as they had already been collected in the morning. That the said Hartog then continued to repeat this question, and that the testifier continued to persist with her previous answer, that there were no eggs, and that the said Hartog then took up a chair and dealt the testifier four blows with it on her right-hand side. That the testifier then went from the *voorhuijs* into the *galderij*, whereupon the aforementioned Hartog demanded from the cook a piece of smoked biltong, which belonged to the testifier and which he had previously asked the testifier to sell him, for which he was willing to offer her a handkerchief, which the cook gave him and which Hartog angrily threw against the left-hand side of her stomach, next to her navel.

That when the testifier had retreated to the kitchen, the aforementioned Hartog asked her why she was so impudent with him, to which she answered: “I was not impudent”. Hartog then, in the presence of the *knecht* Frederik Jansz, who was also in the kitchen, picked up a piece of firewood and dealt the testifier about four blows, both on her back, neck as well as her head, in such a way that this piece of wood came to break, whereupon Hartog took a second piece of wood and again dealt the testifier some blows. This piece of wood then touched the foot of the *knecht*, whereupon he leaped up and pulled the said Hartog from the testifier, after which the testifier went outside.

That in the forenoon of the following day, the testifier, who had been two months pregnant, had a miscarriage as a result of the blows she had received, over which maltreatment the testifier complained to her owner when he came home in the evening.[^1]

There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of her statement as in the text, being willing, if so required, to subsequently confirm the above.

Thus related on the farm of the aforementioned *heemraad* Hercules Adriaan Malan, situated in the Stellenbosch district, on 17 July 1769, in the presence of the *heemraad* Jan Bernard Hoffman and the burgher surgeon George Carel Lodewijk Geering, as witnesses.

This mark X was set down by Juliana van de Caab with her own hand.

As witnesses, \[signed\] J.B. Hoffman, G.C.L. Geering.

With my cognisance, \[signed\] A. Faure, secretary.

[^1]: This testimony was taken three days after the event, and on the farm, which suggests that Malan may have acted on this complaint.
