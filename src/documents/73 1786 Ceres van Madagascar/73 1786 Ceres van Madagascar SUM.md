# CERES VAN MADAGASCAR & APRIL VAN CEIJLON

*In this case, Ceres van Madagascar attacked Louisa, his female partner, because April van Ceijlon had told him that she had been unfaithful with other slaves.[^1] The case reveals the network of relationships and tensions that could develop amongst the slaves on a farm which largely prescribed and confined their world: Louisa’s mother also lived and worked there. Both the attacker and the accuser tried to flee, but were caught and sentenced by the Council of Justice, Ceres for murder and April for ‘malicious accusations’ and incitement to murder.*

[^1]: Slaves could not legally form permanent relationships and this often had a highly deleterious impact on their emotional and personal lives. See 1749 Reijnier van Madagascar, n. 1 for discussion of slave families. For other examples of cases involving rejection or jealousy among slaves, see 1729 Jeptha van Batavia and 1742 Fortuijn van Bengalen.
