# TABLE VALLEY SLAVES

**CJ 340** Criminele Process Stukken, 1736, ff. 97-103 \[modern pagination\].

# *Dictum ter rolle*

Honourable Lords,

As the unruliness, desertion and plotting of slaves are growing daily by such a number, the *eijsscher* considered it necessary to bring this case to the ears of your honours, so that, if possible, these dregs can be kept in check by an exemplary and heavier-than-usual punishment, and in order to stop an insidious evil in this way, even more so as these rogues had their gathering places in the gardens of this Table Valley, which are just above the houses of this settlement, as a result of which, no doubt, sad accidents of fire could yet again have been caused. Since these rogues were sitting there at night, gambling and tippling away, they could easily have got drunk and fallen asleep, and thus fire could have been caused by them, especially as neither masters nor their *knechten* are to be found at night in most of the gardens in that vicinity and, for this reason, these people could play the master as they please. These crooks were this time taken prisoner after midnight, in the garden of the burgher Jan Uijltjes van Laer, by the *burgerwacht[^1] * (warned by the former adjutant Lambregts) who, after they had found the front door locked but the windows open, went to the back door, which also stood open, which is when some *jongens*, upon hearing the noise of this watch, got suspicious and, after they had first snuffed out all the candles, fled through the back windows. However, the former adjutant and burgher Michiel Smuts, who in the meantime had gone to the kitchen, caught there the six crooks and prisoners in this case, finding some of them sitting and eating, others playing, while also finding there a pot of rice, one with meat and curry, and a can of *arack*; so that they were thus banqueting lustily with one another there at their masters’ expense; and who knows if they might not even have been twenty persons strong, and all from the gardens there in the vicinity. These rogues now also make all these gardens unsafe, each stealing at every opportunity all the fruit and vegetables which they can get, which they, or their mates who bring vegetables for sale to the Cape on the orders of their masters, could easily also sell on the side, without their owners ever coming to find out.

Moreover, this plotting at night is also highly hazardous and dangerous, both with regard to the wicked agreements which these dregs reach there with one another and, at times, act out; as also, because of this, all these gardens, which, as said, are looked after only by slaves, are totally exposed to thievery, plundering and still worse misfortunes, since, seeing that nobody is there, the runaways who live in groups on the mountain can do there everything that they please. What is more, these rogues go out and have no thought to take care of the fires in their houses, but leave everything the way it is, as a result of which accidents could easily happen. Besides, one must fear that, unless it is stopped, one only needs to have an evil *jongen* in your house to receive visits such as these at night, and thereby to be exposed to murder and thievery.

Since nothing good can be expected from such plotting at night – in the opinion of the *eijsscher* the owners of these *jongens* should also look after the same and their gardens more carefully, either by placing a European there, or to heed these rogues and take away their opportunities for walking around freely at night to go vagabonding and to form plots in other people’s houses – for the reasons which were cited above, and to prevent such an inveterate evil, as well as to deter all other similar crooks, the *eijsscher* presumes with good reason to demand, as he does with this:

Demanding that all six defendants, with certain judgment by your honours, be sentenced to be severely whipped by the *caffers*, further to be put into chains and to serve thus, without wages, on the Company’s public works for a period of three successive years, with the costs, or to any similar end as your honours would deem fitting.

Exhibit in court, 22 March 1736.

# *Dictum ter rolle*

Honourable Lords,

As the desertion, crowding together and vagabonding of the slaves of people who have gardens in this Table Valley are still not coming to an end, the *eijsscher* finds himself obliged, yet again, to address your honours and to show how, on the 15^th^ of this month, when the *burgerwacht*, while patrolling above the gardens, heard some noise in the little house of the flagman,[^2] they went there and, entering, found sitting there deep in the night, the five prisoners with the flag people, where they were busy drinking coffee. The four *jongens* of the burgher councillor Daniel Pfeil gave as excuse that they were out looking for pigs (which were lost), while the other \[slave said\] nothing; however, this cannot be excused, as the other *jongens* who went out with them during the day to look for these pigs, came home at the proper time, so that these people, by plotting in this way during the night at such places, could not have anything in mind but to commit villainous deeds, and to perform great irregularities should the opportunity arise.

Which is why the *eijsscher* (as he has recently once more had the honour to demonstrate to your honours), in order to prevent such irregularities, presumes to demand, as he does with this:

Demanding that all five prisoners and defendants, with certain judgment by your honours, be sentenced to be whipped by the *caffers*, and to be put into chains for one year, to be sent home thus to their master, with the costs, or to any similar end as your honours would deem fitting.

Exhibit in court, 26 April 1736.

According to Haafner (1992: 70), the hut was about two-thirds of the way up Lion’s Head. There was another ‘flagman’ at Signal Hill (Worden et al. 1998: 53).
