Statement given, on the requisition of the titular merchant and landdrost, the honourable Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, and in the presence of the undersigned *heemraden*, the honourables, Christman Joël Ackerman and Pieter Gerhard Wium, by the little slave boy Lakij, about 12 years old, belonging to the burgher Isaak de Villiers Jansz, going as follows:

That some days ago, the testifier, who had to look after the youngest child of his owner, was ordered by his mistress to fetch a basket from somewhere else, and went to do this and left the child alone on the stoep, and when, a moment thereafter, he heard it crying, he ran back and saw that it had fallen off the stoep.

That his mistress, who discovered this, informed his owner of it, who then had him laid down on the ground and held tight by four *jongens*, while his owner beat him on his buttocks with a *sjambok* (as the visible scars thereof, as well as lashes previously received on his back, themselves also proved this to the aforementioned *heemraden*) and afterwards, when his mistress said that the testifier was a rogue and would run away after receiving the beating, he had a chain put on his leg.

That by eventide the testifier left home and went to the burgher Isaak Minnaar to complain over this; that the said Minnaar kept him that night with him and the following day sent him to Stellenbosch.

There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, declaring it to be the whole truth.

Thus related at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch on 11 January 1790.

This mark X was set down with his own hand by the testifier.

As delegates, \[signed\] C. Joël Ackerman, P.G. Wium.

With my cognisance, \[signed\] J.P. Faure, secretary.
