Today, 6 February 1741, Julij van Bengalen, bondsman of the widow of Jurgen Radijn, confessed to us that, some days ago now, he was in the veld with the sheep of his mistress and, because he wanted to roast the fish which he had in his knapsack, he made a fire in a porcupine hole, as a result of which the veld caught fire heavily. This slave Julij was then, in the presence of the honourable landdrost and us, the undersigned deputised *heemraden*, severely whipped here by the *caffers* for this, while the honourable landdrost also advised this slave Julij to refrain in future from making fire in the veld, or, if he did not, to be punished, in accordance with the *plakkaat*, with the rope on the gallows until death follows.
