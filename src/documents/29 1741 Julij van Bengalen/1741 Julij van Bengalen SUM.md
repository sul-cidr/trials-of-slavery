# JULIJ VAN BENGALEN

*Julij van Bengalen accidentally set fire to the veld when cooking fish out of doors. The case was not considered serious enough to send to the Council of Justice,[^1] but Julij received a whipping and a stern warning from the landdrost. Fire was a particular danger in a community where wood was used extensively in building, and detailed measures were taken to punish those who caused it, either deliberately or by accident.[^2]*

[^1]: There is no record for this case in the criminal *regtsrollen* or criminal case documents for 1741, CJ 23 and CJ 346.

[^2]: There was a standard article relating to making fires in the veld in all the *generale plakkaten* re-issued regularly, see e.g. *Kaapse Plakkaatboek* II: 52-3 (art. 65, 1715), 125 (art. 77, 1727), 191 (art. 77, 1740), in which the punishment for a second offence was death by hanging. Just before this case, there was also a special *plakkaat* re-iterating the dangers, *Kaapse Plakkaatboek* II: 196-7 (1741). Arson was particularly severely punished (see, for example, 1717 Aaron van Bengalen and 1724 Andries van Ceijlon).
