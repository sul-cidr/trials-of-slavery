# OCTOBER VAN MADAGASCAR ET AL.

**CJ 795** Sententiën, 1782-1789, ff. 329-52.

Since October van Madagascar, bondsman of the burgher Simon van Blerck; Felix van Timor, slave of the burgher Jan Lavocade; Pieter van Manade, slave of the former burgher councillor, the honourable Jan Karnspek; Anthonij van Bengalen, bondsman of the burgher fire-master, *Sieur* Arend van Wielig, each thirty years old at a guess; Jan van Bengalen, slave of the aforementioned burgher fire-master, *Sieur* Arend van Wielig; Maij van Mosambicque, slave of the burgher Jan Krige, each twenty-five years old at a guess; Carolus van Madagascar, slave of the burgher Jacobus Louw, thirty years old at a guess; Damon van Bougies, slave of the burgher Jacobus Bierman, forty years old at a guess; and October van Nias, bondsman of the burgher Jan Bierman, twenty-five years old at a guess; currently their honours’ prisoners, voluntarily confessed and since it has appeared evident to the honourable Council of Justice:

That the prisoners October van Madagascar and Felix van Timor, as also Mentor, slave of the burgher Jan Franke, Rampij, female slave of the burgher Pieter Weijdeman, Fortuijn and November, bondsmen of the burgher Jan Bierman, ran away from their owners and went to Hanglip and found there a fellow runaway slave, Cupido van Ternaten of the widow of the late burgher Thomas Dreijer, who had since become ill in the prison and moreover died and, on account of the manifold thefts committed by him, was dragged to the outer place of execution and buried there under the gallows.[^1]

That the prisoner Carolus went with the aforementioned Cupido and the still-fugitive slave Job of the widow Eckhard[^2] to the farm of the burgher Jan Otto and stole there two horses from the stable, and were pursued the following morning by the aforesaid Otto and the burgher Jan Wilkens.

That the aforementioned Otto then hit the said Job with a shot of chopped bullets, but that they nonetheless transported both these horses to their place of residence, without one of them being taken prisoner or the aforesaid Job dying of the wounds he had received.

That thereupon the prisoner Pieter went with the aforesaid November to the farm of the former heemraad, *Sieur* Willem Morkel, and broke into the mill house there, and stole from it: two saws, one hand-axe, two cutting knives, one wood axe, one hand-brace, one pair of compasses, one sliding rule, two garden shears, one copper boiler, two leather aprons and two planes; which aforementioned goods were, however, all found again some time thereafter by a commando of burghers and returned to the aforementioned Morkel.

That after committing this theft, the aforementioned Mentor, Fortuijn and November returned to their respective owners, were severely whipped in front of the prison, while Mentor and Fortuijn were riveted in chains. Which punishment the Council has considered to be commensurate with their misdemeanours, for which reason their honours decided to leave it at that, and therefore let them remain in chains for one year.

That next, the prisoners Cupido, October van Madagascar, Felix, Pieter and October van Nias, as also the still fugitive Jacob and Alias, repaired to the farm of the burgher Cornelis van Nieuwkerken and stole six oxen from there, but when they wanted to transport these to their place of residence at Hanglip, one of these fell into the sea on the way and the other one ran away, but the remaining four, were, however, partly consumed by them and the prisoner Damon.

That the aforesaid prisoners Cupido, October van Madagascar, Felix and Pieter, as also the aforementioned, still-fugitive Jacob and Alias, then went to the Knoflooks Craal and, when they saw the wagon of the burgher Arnoldus Flock being outspanned there, they broke open that night, when this man had fallen asleep, the small chest at the back of the wagon and stole from it: three pieces of paper money, six pieces of silver money, three loaves of bread and some powder and lead, and moreover, from the wagon also: a steenbok and a bag with pickled herring; after which the prisoners separated and left the group so that Cupido and October van Madagascar remained on their own.

That some time thereafter, the aforementioned Cupido and October van Madagascar went to the farm of the former heemraad, *Sieur* Johannes Albertus Meijburg, where they, with the utmost care, broke out, with lock and all, the hasp in which the staple of the padlock locks and stole one *schepel* of flour in two bags, after which they again put back the same staple in such a way that nobody there at that place knew of or discovered this theft or break-in, until the time when the prisoners were apprehended and both the bags, marked with the name of the aforesaid Meijburg, were found with them.

That some time thereafter, when the said Cupido and October wanted to set out thither, they met the prisoners Anthonij and Jan at the Dunes, which is when they all went together to the farm of the burgher Jan Krige, picked up the prisoner Maij from there, and together stole some fruit from the garden whereafter they again returned to Hanglip.

That after the prisoners Cupido, October van Madagascar, Anthonij, Jan and Maij had together roamed around for some days looking for food, they finally proceeded to the farm of the aforesaid Cornelis van Nieuwkerken, where they saw a wagon standing before the house and found two Hottentots sleeping under it, in spite of which the prisoners Cupido and Jan had the audacity to steal the small back chest from the wagon and to take it to the prisoners October van Madagascar, Anthonij and Maij, who in the meantime had been looking for fruit and vegetables in the slaves’ garden.[^3]

That when the little chest was broken open by the prisoners Cupido, October van Madagascar and Jan, the following were found in it: one woman’s purse with silver clasps, one pair of silver shoe buckles, one pair of gold ear-rings, one black silk skirt *en tablier*,[^4] one small jacket and dress of yellow chintz, one small jacket and dress of white chintz, one dress of white chintz, one dress of white chintz with a border, three women’s shifts, three men’s nightshirts, six white kerchiefs, one hat, one pair of black trousers, one black jacket, two knitted bonnets, two razors and some clean linen; while all the prisoners claim not to have found any paper money in it, which, if it had been there, they presume must have been in a packet which they, thinking it to be letters, had torn up[^5] and, together with a large part of the woman’s clothes, hid amongst the bushes and stones, without the prisoner Jan being able to point it out or to find it again.[^6] The prisoners Cupido and October took a small part and the prisoner Jan a large part of the aforesaid goods for themselves, whereas the prisoners Anthonij and Maij did not receive any of it.

That after this, the prisoners set out to the Palmiten River, which is when the prisoner Anthonij got separated from the others and went to the farm of the aforesaid Krige where he was discovered by the slave Jephta, belonging to the aforesaid Krige, and was taken prisoner with the help of two *Bastaard-Hottentotten* who happened to be on the said farm.

That when the prisoners Cupido, October van Madagascar, Jan and Maij missed their aforesaid fellow prisoner Anthonij, they set out to the farm of the aforesaid Krige in order to, as some of the prisoners pretend, search for their comrade, yet, as most of them say, to entice the remaining slaves of the aforementioned Krige. The prisoner Maij then went through the back door of the house into the kitchen and when he called out to the slave Adam – who usually sleeps there but where, on this occasion, a Hottentot by the name of Jan was stationed – and did not receive any answer, he went with the prisoners Cupido, October van Madagascar and Jan, who had been standing before the kitchen door, to the slave house.

That in the meantime, the aforementioned Hottentot Jan went around the outside to the front door of the house and when the door was opened at his knocking, this Hottentot informed the wife of the aforesaid Krige that runaway slaves were there, whereupon the wife of the said Krige ordered him to go to her son-in-law, the burgher Daniel Joubert, who lived nearby, and to inform him of this.

That when this Hottentot, assuming that the aforesaid prisoners were inside the slave house at this time, wanted to go via the back of it to the said Joubert, he discovered the prisoners Cupido and Jan there.

That upon seeing the aforementioned prisoners, the same Hottentot went to lie on his stomach on the ground in the hope that he would not be noticed by them, yet both of the prisoners came to him and, when he got up, the prisoner Cupido threatened to stab him with an *assegaaij*, but – on the suggestion of the prisoners October and Maij, who had been posted at the road in order to watch out in case somebody was coming, but had returned in the meantime; and on the Hottentot’s pretext that he himself was a runaway and had wanted to steal grapes but was chased away and even left his jacket behind in his flight – did not do so and instead accepted him as a fellow comrade.

That the prisoners Cupido, October van Madagascar, Jan and Maij took the Hottentot with them off the farm of the said Krige, and proceeded to the farm of the burgher ...[^7] Naude, where they wanted to steal a sheep, but failed to do this as day was breaking.

That as the prisoners had been walking throughout the whole night and were therefore were very tired, they went together in the bushes at some height on the side of a dune, and lay down to sleep, while the Hottentot, under the pretext that if he remained and lay with them and Europeans came along, they might all be taken for runaways and be captured, but if they let him lie some distance away from them in the nearby bushes, he would, in the event of Europeans coming along, then pretend that he had been sent by their *baas* with them – who he would then say had laid themselves down there – to look for oxen, and that these Europeans would then not take them prisoner, went on his own to some bushes situated closer to the road.

That when this Hottentot noticed that the said prisoners Cupido, October van Madagascar, Jan and Maij had fallen asleep, he crawled along the ground until he had advanced some way from them, whereafter he made haste and thus within a short time got to this side of the so-called Saxenburg Kloof and continued this way until the area of the farm of the aforesaid Krige, when he saw from afar the aforementioned burgher Daniel Joubert, with some burghers on the road to Stellenbosch, and meanwhile called to them until they turned around and noticed him, \[whereupon\] they returned to the farm of the said Krige and stayed there until he reached them, which is when the said Joubert, with the aforementioned two burghers and two *Bastaard-Hottentotten*, was informed by this Hottentot Jan of the place where the four said prisoners, Cupido, October van Madagascar, Jan and Maij, were, and immediately set out to that place with the Hottentot Jan, finding on their arrival the aforesaid four prisoners, Cupido, October van Madagascar, Jan and Maij, asleep, who, after some resistance shown by the aforesaid Jan, were however all taken prisoner, as they were also, together with the other prisoners, delivered into the hands of justice.

And since a flight like this, accompanied by burglary and theft, cannot under any circumstances be left unpunished in a country where law and justice are upheld, but ought to be punished as an example and deterrent to other similar rogues.

Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, serving today, having carefully read and considered the written *crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie*, drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoners by the landdrost of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, the honourable *koopman* Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, in his official capacity, as well as having noted the prisoners’ voluntary confessions, further everything that served the case and could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the United Netherlands, and having judged the prisoners, is sentencing them with this: to be taken to the place where criminal sentences are usually executed here, where the prisoners October van Madagascar, Felix, Pieter, Anthonij, Jan, Maij and Carolus are to be handed over to the executioner, thereupon to be tied to a stake, the prisoner October van Madagascar to be severely scourged with rods on his bare back and to be riveted in chains for a period of three years, and thus forthwith to be sent home to his owner; the prisoners Felix, Pieter, Jan and Carolus, likewise to be severely scourged with rods on their bare backs, further to be riveted in chains for a period of two years and thus forthwith to be sent home to their owners; the prisoners Anthonij and Maij also to be severely scourged with rods on their bare backs, whereafter they are to be riveted in chains for a period of one year and thus to be sent home forthwith to their owners; the prisoners Damon and October van Nias to witness this aforementioned punishment, whereafter they are to be whipped by the *caffers* and to be riveted in chains for a period of one year, thus to be sent home forthwith to their owners; with sentencing them to the costs and expenditure of justice, and denying the further or otherwise drawn-up *eijsch* and delivered *conclusie* of the officer.[^8]

Thus done and sentenced at the Cape of Good Hope on 24 Augustus 1786, as also pronounced in the Castle of Good Hope on the 2^nd^ of the thereupon following month September, and executed on the same day.

Let the sentence be done, \[signed\] C.J. van de Graaff.

[^1]: Being buried there was considered dishonourable and therefore a form of punishment, see 1766 Carel Boom, n. 4.

[^2]: This Job was captured some months later, and tried with some of his accomplices; see below 1786 Job van Madagascar et al. He also features in 1785 Spadilje van Siam.

[^3]: On slave gardens, see 1770 Jephta van de Caab, n. 1.

[^4]: The word *gon* is the French *gone*, ‘skirt’, while *tabillée* (written in some of the other testimonies as *tabelje*) is an attempt to approximate the pronunciation of the French word *tablier*, ‘apron’. In the eighteenth century the decorative apron, which was fastened to the dress, was an important fashion accessory, often made of expensive material (Strutt 1975: 72). This here is a skirt which is *en tablier*, meaning it was trimmed to look as if it has an apron, without it actually being a separate garment, see Strutt 1975: 202. We are grateful to Vanessa Everson and Karel Schoeman for their help in solving this.

[^5]: Paper money had been only recently introduced and the slaves may therefore not have recognised it as money. See 1791 Baatjoe, n. 1.

[^6]: The case is particularly revealing for showing what runaway slaves stole and what they valued (not paper money or letters, or women’s clothes).

[^7]: Left blank in the original.

[^8]: These sentences were recorded in the *regtsrollen*, CJ 68, ff. 134-36. They were somewhat less severe than the recommendations of the *eijsch* that Cupido and October be displayed under the gallows with a rope around their necks, be branded and sent in chains to Robben Island for life and that Pieter, Felix and Jan be beaten with rods and placed in chains on Robben Island for three years, CJ 423, ff. 386-88.
