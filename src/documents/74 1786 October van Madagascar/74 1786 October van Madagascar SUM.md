# OCTOBER VAN MADAGASCAR ET AL.

*This group of runaway slaves (which unusually included a female) joined the community of runaways at Hangklip which had been in existence since at least the 1720s.[^1] They seem to have been fugitives for a long time and to have eluded several commandos, indicative of how well they knew the terrain. They were finally captured when they were given away by a Khoi who had been forced to join them when he accidentally came across them.[^2]*

*The composition of the group was constantly changing; this was not a band of people who ran away together and stayed together. Groups divided and subdivided, met up and joined with others over time. The case thus demonstrates the widespread presence of runaways and the extent of their activities (from the Overberg to Stellenbosch).*
