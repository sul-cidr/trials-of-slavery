In this tragic case, Cupido van Mallabaar threatened to take his own life, as well as that of his owner’s wife and her child.[^1] The episode reveals an intense emotional crisis. Cupido’s complaints that he was made to wear clothing that he was not used to, and that his owners had bought neither other slaves to assist him, nor a female slave to be his companion, reveal the frustrations and alienation of a slave on a Drakenstein farm whose owners merely laughed at his grievances. His ambivalent feelings towards his owners are shown by his vacillation between pity for his mistress and her child and his threats to them.[^2]

The case shows how hard it must have been for an imported slave to adapt culturally to alien circumstances and gives a glimpse into the ways in which he felt and responded to what he experienced at the Cape.

[^1]: The circumstances are somewhat similar to *amok* cases (see 1744 Barkat van Timor for notes on this), although, unlike *amok* perpetrators, Cupido hesitated over his actions because of his conflicting emotions towards his owners.

[^2]: Other documentation in the case includes the *eijsch*, the *interrogatoriën* of Cupido van Mallabaar, and the testimony of Maria Klaasz, Jan van der Straten’s wife, CJ 344, ff. 302-20. Cupido admitted everything in his answers to the questions in his *interrogatoriën*, including his intention to murder his owner, stating that he had acted ‘het eene uijt dronkenschap en het andere uijt bangigheijt’ (partly because of drunkenness and partly through fear), CJ 344, f. 315v.
