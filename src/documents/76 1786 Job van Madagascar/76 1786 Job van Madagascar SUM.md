# JOB VAN MADAGASCAR ET AL.

*This case provides details of the ways in which a group of runaways hiding out on Table Mountain were able to sustain themselves.[^1] They had links with the runaway community at Hangklip,[^2] as well as with slaves in Cape Town, who provided them with food and a hiding place. They moved between the mountain and the town, raiding houses and farms, and at one stage brought captured cattle to the mountain. That such a network existed in the vicinity of the town as late as the 1780s shows how tentative was the Companyâ€™s control over its slave population, even in the heart of the colony.[^3]*

[^1]: On the popularity of Table Mountain as a refuge for slave runaways, see 1735 Company slaves n. 1.

[^2]: On the runaway slave community at Hangklip, see 1737 Aron van Madagascar, n. 1. It seems to have revived in the 1780s, or at least to have come again to the attention of the authorities. After a spate of cases dealing with it in the 1730s (in this volume see 1737 Aron van Madagscar), another group of cases appeared before the Council of Justice in the 1780s (see this one, 1785 Spadilje van Siam and 1786 October van Madagascar).
