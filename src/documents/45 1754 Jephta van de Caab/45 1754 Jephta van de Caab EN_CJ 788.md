# JEPHTA VAN DE CAAB

**CJ 788** Sententiën, 1750-1755, ff. 179-183.

Since, from both the written *eijsch* supplied by the honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, as well as the confession made in court by Jephta van de Caab, bondsman of the first chief surgeon of the hospital here, *sieur* Bartho de St. Jean, 16 years old at a guess, currently their honours’ prisoner, it has appeared evident to the honourable Council of Justice of this governement:

That on the morning of Sunday, which was the 4^th^ of this current month August, after the service had been concluded, when the honourable fiscal, together with the rest of the church congregation, wanted to proceed home from the Lord’s house here, and had already, along with the said congregation, got to the inside portal of the church: the prisoner, provided with a coat and parasol, thought it good to push between – with much rudeness and almost with force or fury – the honourable fiscal and some of his fellow principal lords of this government,[^1] and their wives as well as a throng of other *juffrouwen*, who were all leaving the church together, into the church, on account of which the honourable fiscal then, thinking at first that this rude intrusion performed by the prisoner was done purely out of ignorance, pushed the prisoner from him, while saying: “Scoundrel, get out of the church!”, expecting that the prisoner would guiltily obey this, but far from it. That the prisoner thereupon, not only for the second time pushed against the said honourable fiscal with one and the same insolence, and for which he was given a blow by his honour with his cane, but that he also, since he could not find any space to push through at the side of the honourable fiscal, insolently dared to attempt entering the church on the other side of the portal, but was seen doing this by the honourable fiscal. That the congregation leaving the church was much annoyed by the extraordinary rudeness of the prisoner, and therefore the congregation was told by his honour that they must let this boy go out of the church, but the prisoner finally dared to go so far by also snarling, very insolently: “Well, must I not bring the coat of my *sinjeur*?”; which insolence, however, the prisoner came to regret in the end when he heard publicly from the honourable fiscal that he would soon be found and brought to prison by a *caffer*, as the prisoner then very suddenly, with a tearful countenance, prayed for forgiveness from the aforementioned honourable fiscal, while promising never to do this again, but with which his honour – since it was not only him alone but also the church congregation who got greatly distressed by such a vile scoundrel – can in no ways be content, and then had the prisoner apprehended and riveted in chains.

And since insolencies and bold brutalities like the ones committed can under no circumstances be tolerated, but should be punished exemplarily as a deterrent to other similar vile scoundrels.

Thus it is that honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, serving today, having seen and read with attention the written *crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie*, drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoner by the honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, in his official capacity; moreover, having noted the voluntary confession of the prisoner and further everything else which served the case and could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the United Netherlands, as well as his most serene highness, the Lord Prince of Orange and Nassouw, as hereditary Stadholder, Captain and Admiral General of the Republic, and having judged the prisoner Jephta van de Caab, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the place where criminal sentences are usually executed here, there to be handed over to the executioner and to be tied to a stake, to be severely scourged with rods on his bare back and thus to be sent back home again to his owner, on condition that the same pays the costs and expenditure of justice; the Council denying the further *eijsch* of the honourable officer.[^2]

Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 15 August 1754, as also pronounced and executed on the 7^th^ of the following month September.

Let the execution be done, \[signed\] R. Tulbagh.

\[signed\] S. Swellengrebel, J. Meinertzhagen, Ns. Heijning, Cl. Brand, Corns. Eelders, D. d’Aillij, Jn. Raeck.

In my presence, \[signed\] Jn. Fr. Tiemmendorf, secretary.

[^1]: Jephta had the misfortune of getting in the way of Baron Pieter van Reede van Oudshoorn, who came to the Cape as independent fiscal with the rank of *opperkoopman* in 1741. This office was the third highest position at the Cape. In 1768 he became the successor to Governor Rijk Tulbagh, but died before he could take up office (DSAB II: 795). People left (and entered) the church according to rank, with the governor going out first.

[^2]: The *eijsch* had recommended that Jephta also be sent to work in chains at the public works for five years, CJ 363, f. 331.
