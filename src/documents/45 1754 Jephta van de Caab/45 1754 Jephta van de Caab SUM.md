# JEPHTA VAN DE CAAB

*The sixteen-year-old slave Jephta caused great affront when he pushed his way through the crowd of high-ranking Company officials at the entrance to the church, to bring his master his coat. The episode gives an unusual glimpse of the duties of the private slave of officials and their sensitivity to their dignity.[^1] It moreover illustrates how sensitive contemporary society was to issues of rank and status.[^2] Jephta was charged with insolence and publicly whipped.[^3]*

*The case had an extraordinary aftermath, as on the afternoon of the event Jephta’s mistress, Martha Solliers, went to the fiscal’s house and verbally abused him for arresting her slave. This resulted in a long-drawn-out civil case in which the fiscal sued her for insulting his person and office.[^4]*

[^1]: Jephta was the slave of Bartho de St. Jean, long-standing chief surgeon of the Company who had arrived at the Cape in 1719 and served there until his death in 1763 (VOC 5732, ff. 22, 27, 30-9). Unlike the burgher slaves or the Company slaves housed in the Lodge, the slaves of Company officials were usually not listed in the records and almost nothing is known about them (Shell 1994: 149-51).
