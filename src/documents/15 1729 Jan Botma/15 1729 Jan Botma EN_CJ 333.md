Statement given by Domingo van Goa, bondsman of the farmer Jan Botma, on the requisition of the landdrost Pieter Lourensz, namely:

That when the testifier came home around evening on the 8^th^ of this current month June, his master, the aforementioned Jan Botma, ordered him to help whip with split canes a certain fellow slave, named Joseph van Malabaar (who was naked and bound to a ladder, and already being beaten by his master’s slave, Aaron).

That the testifier having done this for about half an hour, with breaks in-between, together with the aforementioned Aaron, untied the said slave Joseph on the order of his master. Which is when the same \[Joseph\] went to the kitchen, where he sat for a while, after which he went outside through the door and, up to two times, drank there from a pool of rain water.

**CJ 333** Criminele Process Stukken, 1729, f. 274

I, the undersigned surgeon of Drakenstein, attest, on the requisition of the landdrost Pieter Lourensz, to have examined, on the 10^th^ of this current month June and in the presence of the deputised *heemraden*, on the farm of Jan Botma a certain dead slave, named Joseph, belonging to the aforesaid Botma, and to have found that the same was whipped, although unable to find any mortal wounds on the same, but presumes that this *jongen* Joseph must have drowned in the water, seeing that, when he had turned the same over, water ran from his mouth.

All of which I offer, if necessary, to confirm subsequently.

Stellenbosch, 20 June 1729,
