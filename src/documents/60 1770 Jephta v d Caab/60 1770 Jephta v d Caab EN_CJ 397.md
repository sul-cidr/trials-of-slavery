To the honourable Jan Willem Cloppenburg, president, as well as the honourable Council of Justice of this government.

Honourable lord and lords!

Upon receiving the news from the widow of the late burgher Roelof van der Burg, that one of her slaves, by the name of Caesar, had been beaten to death on her farm, situated in the Wagenmakers valley, the undersigned landdrost had the corpse inspected and did the necessary enquiries, for which reason he has the honour to present, in accordance with the tenor of this information, with all respect: That at nine o’clock, at a guess, on the morning of the 20^th^ of the past month September, when the slave *jongen* Pandek van Maccasser, or the testifier in \[the document marked with\] the letter A, was on his way to labour in the vineyard on the farm of his mistress, and his fellow slaves Caesar and Jephta, along with the Hottentot Dirk, were going along the same way leading past the gardens of the slaves, in order to plant onions there, the slave Jephta not only cleaned, but also tried to appropriate for himself, the bamboo growing there and planted by Pandek himself in his own garden; wherefore the said Jephta was prevented from doing this by Pandek and was at the same time informed that he, Pandek, had planted this bamboo himself in his garden and that it therefore belonged to him alone; about which there then developed between them both an altercation, with the aforementioned Jephta several times challenging Pandek to fight, to which Pandek was in no ways inclined but carried on with his work in the vineyard.

Upon seeing that the Hottentot Dirk also started to quarrel over the bamboo and then came to blows with the said Jephta, and also that the slave Caesar picked up a piece of wood and proceeded with it towards the fighting parties, Pandek likewise went thither in order to prevent this quarrel and, since the said Caesar, at the very moment of his arrival, raised up high the piece of wood he held in his hands in order to beat the Hottentot Dirk with it, Pandek, while saying to Caesar: “What are you going to do? You mustn’t hit!”, tried to separate the fighting men from each other, which was to no effect. That the said Caesar cast that piece of wood from him, but grabbed the aforesaid Pandek by the front of his hair, while Pandek did the same to the said Caesar, so that in this way they both started struggling with each other.

That the aforementioned Jephta then let the Hottentot Dirk go free in order to go and help his father, the aforementioned Caesar, and picked up a bamboo stick lying close by at an oak tree, intending, or so it seemed to the said Pandek from the movements made by Jephta, to give Pandek a blow with it, but that this blow missed him – both through the sudden storming forward of the aforementioned Jephta, and through the movement which Pandek and the said Caesar were making with their heads during their struggle – and instead of hitting him, Pandek, it hit Caesar, or the father of the said Jephta, as a result of which the same remained lying on the ground as if suffering from heavy dizziness, whereupon he was taken to the house of his mistress and passed away that very day as a result of this wound.

And here, honourable lord and your honourables, you have the case presented to you in accordance with the story of the aforementioned Pandek. Hence, when the aforementioned slave Jephta, in consequence of the above narration of his fellow slave Pandek, and then the Hottentot Dirk, as a result of the accusation made by the said Jephta, were taken into custody, the undersigned spared no trouble in order to shed greater light on this case, but since nobody else other than the aforementioned slaves Pandek and Jephta, as also the said Hottentot Dirk, were present at the event in question, the undersigned could not find even the least bit of elucidation and, accordingly, interrogated Dirk and Jephta before the honourable delegates from this illustrious Court of Justice, in which \[interrogation\] Dirk agrees with the principal tenor of the above statement given by Pandek, with the exception that Dirk answered on the ninth question, namely: “If the prisoner started quarrelling with Jephta, and over what did this originate?”, answer: Not to have had any quarrel with Jeptha, but that when Pandek and Jephta were fighting over the bamboo, he had helped them apart and that Jeptha then threw him down and bit him on his thumb, denying also: that the older slave had had a bamboo stick in his hands, that the said Pandek, at the moment when the said Caesar had already raised the bamboo and wanted to hit the said Dirk with it, had prevented this blow, and that he had said to the aforementioned Caesar: “What are you doing? You mustn’t hit!” The said Jephta denied everything in his interrogation, saying that Pandek was the *auctor rixae[^1] * and had challenged him, Jephta, with a knife when he was busy weeding the bamboo on the order of his father, Caesar; see the answers to articles 5 and 7; as also that when Pandek had finally left him, the Hottentot Dirk, who has always ganged up with Pandek, then quarrelled with him over the whip-sticks, or the aforementioned bamboo, without him wanting to know anything about his father, Caesar, coming to help with a bamboo stick or a piece of wood; as can be seen in the answers to articles 8 and following; saying moreover that when Pandek was fighting with his father, Caesar, he had put his knee on the chest of his father, who had fallen backwards between two grapevines, and then took him by the hair and thus got to wrestle together, upon which sight Jephta came to help his father; without him wanting to know anything about having taken a bamboo stick and dealing his father a blow with it; saying, on the contrary, that the Hottentot Dirk had taken the bamboo stick, which was standing behind an oak tree and was being used in a shelter, and wanted to deal him, Jephta, a blow with it, but that he had managed to dodge this blow, as a result of which his father was hit, with him even calling at that moment: “O God! Father! Dirk hit you!”; in which manner he, Jephta, is trying to excuse himself wholly.

It is indeed true that the slave Pandek had been the first to start the quarrel or disagreement with the aforementioned Jephta, and so can be taken for the *auctor rixae*, yet when one considers that Jephta was trying to appropriate that which belonged to the aforementioned Pandek and was planted by himself, probably for his own use, and wanted to exercise power over it, so it is certain that the said Jephta occasioned it and was thus the prime cause of it; this having been established, that the aforementioned Jephta, after Pandek had gone from him, got involved in an altercation with the Hottentot Dirk because Dirk had pulled the aforementioned Pandek from him, and the said Caesar, or the person who got hit, thinking that Dirk was fighting with his said son Jephta, therefore came to help him, as also that Pandek, since the said Caesar, according to what he \[Pandek\] says, had a piece of wood in his hand and was of the intention to hit the aforementioned Dirk with it, tried to separate the two fighters from each other, and to this end pulled the old *jongen* from Dirk, when the said Caesar in his turn then took on Pandek, the natural love of the slave Jephta had such an effect that he assisted his old and decrepit father, who was far too weak to fight against Pandek, and thus, thinking to give the said Pandek a blow with a bamboo stick which stood behind an oak tree, in order to release his father, in an accidental manner hit his own father.

In spite of all the attempts that the undersigned had endeavoured to bring the aforesaid Jephta to confess, he was unable to succeed with this because, although he often and repeatedly impressed upon him that, by coming to the aid of his father, he had after all only done that which love for his father inspired him to do, since the bonds of nature could not tolerate that his aged father be beaten by another, therefore coming to the aid of his father can in no ways be considered an unreasonable matter, and that therefore the blow he dealt his said father, as appears from the course of all the particulars of the disagreement in question, could certainly only have been done by accident; so that it would be best if he confesses the whole matter, since one, as said before, can comprehend clearly from the circumstances that he had, if not *animo doloso*,[^2] nonetheless done it; but this was all in vain, since he absolutely continued to deny having dealt the blow with the bamboo stick, alleging in his answer to the 17^th^ question of his interrogation: That the Hottentot Dirk had tried to deal him, Jephta, a blow with the bamboo stick standing behind the oak tree, while Pandek and his father were busy fighting, yet that he had dodged this blow, which is when his father, the aforementioned Caesar, was hit, and that he had even called: “O God, Father! Dirk is hitting you!”, as also, to the 20^th^ article, that after the incident he had run to the house and told his mistress that they were beating his father to death, which is confirmed by the wife of the burgher Hendrik Groothuijs, who had been with his mistress at this time, in her statement added hereto under the letter D, which statement, however, the undersigned had left unverified since the deponent, who lives elsewhere in the rural areas, did not have anything else to state regarding this case. Now, as regards the abovementioned by Jephta concerning the announcement he made to his mistress, namely: That they are beating his father to death, the undersigned has to put forward that this cannot, according to the undersigned’s argument, profit Jephta in the least as regards dealing the blow in question, since it is possible that he – after having dealt this blow and seeing that instead of the slave Pandek, he had hit his aged father, and in such a way that, as a result of this, he remained lying as if suffering from heavy dizziness – could have acted, in order to give his mistress the impression that he had not done it, in this way and made a huge scene as if his father had really been beaten by another.

The undersigned further investigated the accusation made by the said Jeptha concerning the Hottentot Dirk, namely that when Pandek started wrestling with his father, the Hottentot Dirk (surely because Dirk did not want to allow the said Jephta to go and help his father) took the bamboo stick, standing behind an oak tree and being used in a shelter, and wanted to hit Jephta with it, yet that the said Jephta dodged this blow and it thus hit his father; see articles 15 and 16 of his interrogation. This seems not to be devoid of all possibility, even more so when one reflects upon the answer given by the said Jephta to the 10^th^ question of his interrogation, where he says: “Dirk quarrelled with me over the whip-stick (or bamboo stick) since, note well, Pandek and Dirk always ganged up”, through which he probably wants to indicate that they have always been good friends and supported each other, so that one could suppose that Dirk tried to hit the aforementioned Jephta, not only because he came to aid his father, but also because he, according to article 9 of the questions he answered, had thrown him down and bit him on his thumb, which Dirk, however, vigorously denies in article 17 of his questions: that when Pandek and Caesar were fighting, he, in order to prevent any accidents, cast away all the stones and vines from the way, yes even that the said Jephta, when he dealt the blow to Caesar, also touched Dirk since he was in the path of the blow; so that the case, as there were no other witnesses present, remains very complicated and obscure, yet if one believes the testimony of the slave Pandek, which the undersigned thinks squares the best with the case, then the slave Jephta would have come to aid his father out of love, and certainly must have perpetrated the manslaughter beyond his will and expectation, and certainly not with evil and cunning. According to the statement of the district’s surgeon, Georg Carel Lodewijk Geering, the blow to the left side of the head penetrated through the skull to the *dura* and *pia mater*,[^3] whereupon apoplexy and death must have followed. Since the undersigned, on the one hand, is uncertain, due to the mutually produced accusations of the Hottentot Dirk and the slave Jephta, about which one of the two he should act against as guilty in the case of accidentally perpetrated manslaughter, and since, on the other hand, from the circumstances of this case, it seems as if there are no means remaining to the exhibiter for further investigation via one or the other legal avenue, he is having recourse to your honours, humbly requesting that your honours please judge this in such a way as you would deem fitting in accordance with your great wisdom.
