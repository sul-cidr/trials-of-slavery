# ALEXANDER VAN COUCHIN

**CJ 346** Criminele Process Stukken, 1741, ff. 115-16.

Statement given on the requisition of the landdrost, *Sieur* Pieter Lourensz, by the former *heemraad* Daniel van der Lith, the same being of the following contents, namely:

That on the afternoon of the 18^th^ of the past month February, when the testifier wanted to tie up a certain slave named Aurora on the suspicion of having committed theft, he first of all had his slave *jongen* named Alexander, who has a relationship with the aforesaid *meijd* Aurora, tied up as a cautionary measure. However, as the testifier’s wife was appalled by this, the testifier had Alexander untied again, likewise allowing the aforesaid *meijd* Aurora to go as she had seized his wife around her waist and had begged for mercy.

That early in the morning of the following day, the testifier’s *knecht*, Christoffel Jansz, informed him that he had understood from certain slaves that on the previous day, after the slave Alexander was untied again, he had taken a knife in his hand and apparently threatened to kill the testifier with it. Since the testifier had some people \[i.e. visitors\] with him, he allowed this slave Alexander to go free in the meantime, until Friday, the 14^th^ of the said month February, which is when the testifier had the same trussed and had him delivered into the hands of the petitioner and then also informed him of what had happened.

There being nothing more to relate, the deponent[^1] asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, while offering to subsequently confirm this, his statement, at any time, if so required.

Thus recorded at the office of the secretary of justice at the Cape of Good Hope on 5 April 1741 in the presence of the clerks Adriaan van Schoor and Hendrik Emanuel Blanckenberg, as witnesses, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the deponent and me, the secretary.

Today, 13 May 1741, there appears before me, Arnold Schephausen, secretary of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the soldier Christoffel Jansz, currently on loan as *knecht* to the former *heemraad*, Daniel van der Lith, who on the requisition of the landdrost, *Sieur* Pieter Lourensz, declares to be the certain truth:

That on a certain Saturday in the month February, without however knowing the exact date, the deponent was on his master’s farm, situated around Klapmuts, when his master ordered him around midday to tie up a certain slave of his, named Alexander, without the deponent being aware of the reasons.

That the deponent tied up this *jongen* Alexander in the kitchen, and then went to his work. Shortly thereafter there came to him in the wagon-house (where he was busy putting together a wagon) one of his master’s slaves, named Pieter, who said to the deponent: “It is good that you have come from over the mountain,[^2] because that *jongen* wanted to have killed the *baas*”, to which the deponent replied: “My God! That must not be”, after which he again went to the kitchen, where he heard his master speaking very loudly to this *jongen* Alexander. Further, as soon as the deponent came into the kitchen, he said to this *jongen*: “Alexander, go to your work”, to which the same answered: “I don’t want to work today”, after which the deponent again went to his work, without anything else concerning this matter being known to him, declaring besides that he did not see that this *jongen* Alexander had had a knife.

There being nothing more to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, while offering to subsequently confirm this, his deposition, at any time, if this may be required.

Which I declare, \[signed\] A. Schephausen, secretary.
