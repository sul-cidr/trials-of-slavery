Statement, given in the presence of the undersigned deputised *heemraden*, the honourables Johan Bernard Hoffman and Pieter Gerh. Wium, and on the requisition of the landdrost here, the honourable *koopman* Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, by and on behalf of the burgher Johs. Hendrik Roux, of competent age, going as follows: That on the past Tuesday, the 4^th^ of this month, when the testifier was going from his garden to the house with a spade over his shoulder, he saw the burgher Petrus Joubert, who is the *voorzoon[^1]* of his neighbour, the burgher Gerrit Victor, following two of his own slave *jongens*, with a so-called hind oxen *sjambok* in his hand,[^2] and going in the direction of the testifier’s herd of cattle grazing on the opposite side of the Dwars River[^3] on the honourable Company’s veld, fully a thousand paces, at a guess, from the property of the aforesaid Victor. Whereupon the testifier became worried that the said Joubert, as has happened before, might be planning to punish and maltreat the testifier’s cattle herder without any reason; and he therefore rushed home to put away the spade, with the aim to then rush again thither with some of his slaves in order to stop the said Joubert in his intention and to prevent the maltreatment of his slave. And when he had just come out of the house, he noticed very clearly how the aforesaid Joubert had his cattle herder, by the name of Adam, held down to the ground by three of his slaves, while he was busy beating him with the aforesaid *sjambok*.

That the testifier then immediately ran with his four slave *jongens*, as fast as they possibly could, and (after a considerable amount of time had passed because of the difficulty in crossing the river and bushes which were in-between) only when they were nearing the said Joubert at a very short distance, did he stop the beating. Whereupon his punished cattle herder remained lying on the ground; and when the testifier got to him, he found him to have been pitifully maltreated, as the said Adam was lying for dead and powerlessly on the ground, while blood was running from his mouth and nose, and he was severely scourged on his buttocks, in which circumstances the testifier had the same carried and led home by the aforementioned slaves he brought with him; besides having him transported the following day on a wagon to show this \[maltreatment\] to the petitioner and to bring in his complaint concerning this against the aforementioned Joubert.

There being nothing more to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing to confirm the same at any time with solemn oaths.

Thus related at the office of the secretary at Stellenbosch on 6 October 1791.

Statement, given in the presence of the undersigned deputised *heemraden*, the honourables Johan Bernard Hoffman and Pieter Gerh. Wium, and on the requisition of the landdrost here, the honourable *koopman* Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, by and on behalf of Adam van Bengalen, thirty years old at a guess, bondsman of the burgher Johs. Hendrik Roux, going as follows:

That on the past Tuesday, when the testifier, who looks after the stock of his owner, was letting them graze, as per usual, on the honourable Company’s veld on the other side of the Dwars River, the burgher Petrus Joubert, who had three of his slave *jongens* with him, came to the testifier there in the veld, and asked him in essence: “Why are you grazing them here?”, and upon this ordered the aforesaid three *jongens* to hold fast the testifier and to lay him down on the ground, which they also did at once, when the same Joubert beat the testifier with a so-called hind oxen *sjambok*, which he had brought with him, in such a manner that the trousers he was wearing became entirely tattered and the outer skin, as also the flesh, of his buttocks was opened, as if it had been damaged by a knife or another sharp instrument (as the wounds thereof, shown to the undersigned delegates, also clearly indicate). That the testifier – both as a result of the *sjambok* lashes and a blow he received on the back between his shoulder blades with a fist, given either by the aforesaid Joubert or by one of his slaves, which is when he started bleeding – remained lying totally powerless on the ground, when his owner presently got there with four of his fellow slaves, who first carried the testifier some way and thereafter led him home. The testifier also declares to still experience much pain both from the wounds on his buttocks and internally in his chest and the side of his back.

There being nothing more to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of his statement as in the text, declaring it to be the whole truth.

Thus related in the residence of the burgher Pieter Schalk Hugo, situated here in the town, on 6 October 1791.

This mark X was set down by the testifier Adam with his own hand.
