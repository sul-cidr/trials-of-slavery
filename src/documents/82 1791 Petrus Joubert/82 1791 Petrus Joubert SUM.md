# PETRUS JOUBERT

*Slaves could be caught up in disputes between their owners. In this case Adam van Bengalen, a cattle herder owned by Johannes Roux, was severely beaten by Petrus Joubert, son of another burgher, because he was grazing livestock on common land.[^1] Joubertâ€™s slaves assisted him in the task. Roux complained to the local landdrost, but it does not appear that any action was taken against Joubert.[^2]*

[^1]: Nothing about the background to this case is known, but Joubert might have contended the use of the grazing land. The statement that he had beaten the herder before implies that this was a long-standing dispute.

[^2]: These are the only two documents concerning this case in the Stellenbosch records. There is no mention of it in the criminal *regtsrollen*.
