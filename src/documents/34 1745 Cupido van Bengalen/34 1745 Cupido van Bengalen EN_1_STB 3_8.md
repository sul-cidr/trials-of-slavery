To the honourable lord Rijk Tulbagh, president, together with the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope.

Honourable Lord and honourable Lords,

With this, the undersigned landdrost informs your honours with the utmost respect that on the 15^th^ of the just passed month September, when he found himself at the Cape, he received a report from the former *heemraad* Andries Brink that a *jongen* of the former burgher councillor, *Sieur* Andries Grové, named Cupido van Bengalen, who was stationed on the farm of the aforementioned Brink,[^1] named Vischwater, and situated behind Riebeek-Kasteel, had stabbed to death a *meijd* of his, named Francina, who also lived there. Hereupon he at once sent his deputy an order to immediately proceed to that place with delegates and to do an inspection, who, after having done so and returned home again, informed the undersigned that they found the dead body of the aforesaid *meijd* Francina lying next to a hand-mill in the kitchen of the residence and having a cut on her throat, two stabs in her right breast and one in the ribs on her right side, under her arm and, moreover, that the whole head of this female slave was covered in blood, and also that they saw that the window of the room on the left-hand side of the residence, which had been tied to the bolts from the inside with iron wire, had been broken open from the outside and, moreover, that in this room a chest and a cellaret had likewise been broken open and from which some goods, as the *knecht* asserts, were stolen.

That they then understood that the aforementioned slave Cupido van Bengalen, who was said to have been the perpetrator of this murder and housebreaking, had taken his own life in the veld not far from there. They then also proceeded to that place, finding this slave about half an hour from the said farm Vischwater, lying on his face by a small river with a stab in his stomach, from which his intestines were hanging; with a razor, which was open, lying next to his side and, some paces from there, another large knife with its sheath; which will appear more evident to your honours from the declaration of the deputised *heemraden*, attached with this under the letter A. On his return, the deputy brought with him the Hottentot named Louis, who also lived on this farm, and had run away with the aforementioned slave Cupido, and who is currently sitting in the prison here.

That the undersigned, in order to discover if this Hottentot Louis is also guilty of this abominable murder and housebreaking, summoned to him both the *knecht*, the slaves, as well as the Hottentots who were on the farm Vischwater at this time and took statements from the same, who declared that on the night between the 13^th^ and 14^th^ of the recently passed month September, the aforementioned slave Cupido came from the house of the farm Vischwater to the slave house, where he asked the Hottentot Louis and his brother Piet to go with him to the farm of the burgher Pieter van Taak to search for dagga there, upon which they both got up, when Louis went outside, while the Hottentot Piet, since he had thought better of it, lay down again to sleep. When the slave Pieter van Mallabaar, who was lying asleep on his bed in the slave house and did not know anything of this, heard the dogs barking loudly, he went outside to see what was going on and noticed, as soon as he came outside, seeing the moon was shining brightly, that one of the windows of the house on this farm was standing open. He therefore went back again into the slave house and roused a *jongen* of aforementioned Brink, named Dramma, who was lying asleep there, saying to him that the window of the room was open and that this could possibly have been done by runaways and that he must go and inform the *knecht*, commonly known as Schipper Jan, who was at this time on his mother-in-law’s farm, situated about an hour from there. Thereupon Dramma took a horse and went to that place but, when he was not far from the farm, he was thrown off by the horse, yet continued by foot and, on his arrival, roused the aforementioned *knecht* and informed him of the window standing open, whereupon this *knecht* answered him that Dramma should go home and that he would follow him, which is when this slave returned again from there.

After the departure of the slave Dramma, the old slave Pieter went with the aforementioned Hottentot Piet to the house to see what could be done there, with both of them entering after they had opened the latch of the kitchen door, discovering, as soon as they stepped inside, that the *meijd* of the aforesaid Brink, named Francina, who always slept in the house at night, was lying dead by the hand-mill standing there, whereupon they made a fire and lit a stub of candle and inspected the said *meijd* closer, seeing then that the blood of this *meijd* was running along the ground and that the front door of the house was standing open, which door was closed by them. Afterwards they both returned again to the slave house, while, around the time of sunrise, the old slave Pieter ordered the aforementioned Hottentot Piet to go and tell the aforementioned *knecht* Schipper Jan that the *meijd* Francina was dead. This Hottentot then took a horse from the stable and went on his way to do that but, not far from the farm, he met up with the aforementioned slave Dramma, whom he informed of the *meijd* Francina’s death, and that he was supposed to go and tell the *knecht* about this; but then came back again with this slave since the same had answered him that the *knecht* would presently arrive. However, the slave Dramma, after having been at home for a short while, having put a saddle on the horse, again rode off to the *knecht* to inform him of the death of the aforesaid *meijd* Francina and also that there were missing from the farm the aforementioned slave Cupido and the Hottentot Louis. Dramma met with this *knecht* on the road, who ordered him, as soon as he learned of the aforegoing, to ride to Klapmuts and to report this incident to his master, which this *jongen* then also did. On his arrival home, this *knecht*, who is the burgher Jan Nieuwenhuijsen, found the aforementioned *meijd* Francina lying dead on her lefthand side with her left hand under her head in the kitchen, and discovered further that one of the windows of the room, whose bolt had been tied from the inside with iron wire, had been broken open from the outside of the house, with the handle of a grindstone lying underneath the window. He also found missing, as had been reported to him, the slave Cupido and the Hotttentot Louis, also seeing later, when he had gone into the room, that an empty cellaret of his and a chest of the said Brink, which were both in there, had been broken open, and found two shirts and a jacket missing from this chest, as well as two frocks and a pair of leather trousers from the row of pegs there.

The aforementioned Hottentot Piet, who was busy ploughing the field on the 15^th^ (which the *knecht* Jan Nieuwenhuijsen accidentally said to be the 17^th^ in his statement) of the month September, came home from the ploughing and informed the said *knecht* that the old slave and cattle herder Pieter had come with the Hottentot Louis to the plough in the field. Whereupon the wife of the said Nieuwenhuijsen went to the field with the Hottentot Piet and, on her arrival there, ordered the plough to be outspanned and, after this was done, returned to the house with the Hottentot Louis and the *volk* who were \[working\] there. On his arrival there, Louis told this *knecht* that the slave Cupido had said to him: “You are not guilty, you go on home, I have murdered a soul, I will murder myself”, while adding that, when he was leaving, he saw the aforesaid slave Cupido, after first covering his eyes with a cloth, stabbing himself in the stomach with a knife. Upon this, the *knecht* Jan Nieuwenhuijsen tied up this Hottentot Louis and ordered the same to point out the place where this murderer had taken his own life. The Hottentot Louis then pointed out to this *knecht* a place, about half an hour from the house, where there was some blood, finding approximately 100 paces from there the aforementioned slave Cupido lying on the ground on his stomach, being unable to speak, finding also, not far from this slave Cupido, the abovementioned stolen goods, together with a razor and a *riem*. After this, he again set out with the Hottentot Louis on the way to the house to await the delegates, yet, when he was gone some way, the slaves whom he had left with the slave Cupido to look after the same, shouted to him, Nieuwenhuijs \[*sic*\], that the slave Cupido had already died, whereupon he continued on his way and when he came home, he tied the aforesaid Hottentot Louis to a chain, while the burgher Pieter van Taak, who came there the following day, put the said Louis on his wagon and took him to his house in order to take him to Stellenbosch. All of which your honours, if you so desire, would be able to view in greater detail in the verified statements of the *knecht* Jan Nieuwenhuijsen, attached hereto under the letter B, of the slaves Pieter van Mallabaar and Dramma van Timor, under the letters C and D, and that of the Hottentot Piet under the letter E.

Since the undersigned understood from all four of the aforementioned testimonies that the Hottentot Louis is not in his right mind, as he continually absented himself from the other Hottentots and slaves, acting in strange ways when on his own, just as a person who is out of his mind, sometimes speaking, laughing and dancing out loudly, without anybody being with him; he took down, in the presence of delegates from this honourable Council, a confession by the Hottentot Louis in order to discover the truth about this, discovering in his reasoning no great senselessness, except that he sometimes varied in his answers and that, when the statements were verified, he protested every time that he is not senseless or crazy, even though this was still maintained by the witnesses. He, Louis, did not add anything in his whole confession, which is attached with this under the letter F, other than that he was violently forced by the slave Cupido to go with him; that this *jongen* first, before the door of the slave house, threatened to stab him with a knife because of his unwillingness, that later on, when they were inside the room and he refused to hold the light, he did it again; that when they got into the *voorhuijs*, he tied him to his own body with a *riem* until such time as the aforementioned slave Cupido ordered him to go to the house in order to inform the *knecht* that he would be taking his own life; denying further, to have been instrumental in any way in either the murder of the *meijd*, or the breaking open of the window, nor that of the chest and cellaret, nor in any of the other committed thefts; and of which the undersigned must admit to be unable, due to a lack of evidence, to prove anything to the contrary against this Hottentot.

It is then, honourable Lord and honourable Lords, because of these two reasons, viz. the evidence that this Hottentot is senseless and that the same declares to have no part or guilt in any or all of this, that the undersigned finds himself forced to turn to your honours to humbly enquire from you what, in your sage opinion, he should do and how he should deal with this Hottentot Louis, and what else he should do concerning this case.

Which I do, etc.[^2]

[^1]: Cupido van Bengalen, like Pieter van Malabar, was working on the farm of his owner’s son-in-law, presumably to help with the ploughing that was taking place. Hiring of slaves, or their loan by kin, during peak labour periods was a common practice, Worden 1985: 25 and 87-8.
