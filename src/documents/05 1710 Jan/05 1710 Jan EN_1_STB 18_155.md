**1/STB 18/155** Notariële Verklaringen, 1706-1714, unpaginated.

Today, 9 June in the year 1710, we, the undersigned *heemraden*, Pieter van der Bijl, Warnar van den Brink, together with the secretary, Jan Mahieu, and the messenger of the court, Sebastiaan Schröder, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, S.M. de Meurs, and on the request of the farmer David Heufke, set out to the farm or country place of the said Heufke, situated at Stellenbosch, to inspect his slave named Jan. Thus it is that we declare, after a proper inspection, that the said slave had a wound on his head, going upwards to the temple of the head, which he said he himself had inflicted with a knife, because he did not wish to live any longer, saying besides, in essence: “I wish to die or to be sold, because I cannot keep up with working.”[^1]

Thus investigated and done at the aforesaid place and day.

\[signed\] P. van der Bijl, W. v.d. Brinck.

\[signed\] Jan Mahieu, secretary.

\[signed\] Sebastian Schröder, messenger of the court.

[^1]: This literally means ‘I cannot give satisfaction with my work’ but in this context the suggested translation seems more likely.
