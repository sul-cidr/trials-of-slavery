*Another brief note in the Stellenbosch records which gives a poignant insight into the desperation to which some slaves were reduced. Slave suicides were relatively common and were of concern to their owners and the authorities, not least because they were thus deprived of valuable property.[^1]*

[^1]: About fifteen to twenty slave suicides a year were reported. Slaves who unsuccessfully tried to commit suicide were punished as a warning to others, Worden 1985: 134-7. See also 1786 Sara.
