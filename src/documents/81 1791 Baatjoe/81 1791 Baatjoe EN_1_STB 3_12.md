Statement, given in the presence of the undersigned deputised *heemraden* and on the requisition of landdrost here, the honourable *koopman* Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, by Rosetta van de Caab, 24 years old at a guess, bondswoman of the former first chief surgeon of this government, the honourable Pieter Domus, which goes as follows:

That her husband, who is a slave of the burgher Pieter Lens, living at the Cape, and named Baatjoe, who now and then gets aboard the ships in the roadsteads there, gave to the testifier some half worn-out \[ship’s\] blankets in order to sell them here. On a certain Wednesday, at the beginning of the just-passed month of May, the slave *jongen* of the burgher Hermanus Combrink, named Sangoor, came to the testifier, while she was in front of the residence of her owner, to buy one of these blankets, and handed over to the testifier a piece of paper money which he claimed to be five rixdollars, while adding that the testifier must pay out to him the change above the 14 *schellingen* which the said blankets \[*sic*\] would cost. The testifier, since she was not very sure of the value of the note, answered the said slave Sangoor that she first needed to find out how much it was \[worth\] and that she would then pay out the rest to him.[^1]

That when the testifier was sent that very same day by her mistress to the widow Ginsenberg to enquire if she had bananas for sale, she on this occasion requested a little slave *meijd* of the said widow Ginsenberg, named Jamila, to go and show the aforementioned piece of money to the former messenger of the court Faustman,[^2] who lived next door, and to ask him the value of it, with the aim to afterwards let this little *meijd*, who was ready to depart and go to the honourable Ackerman, buy her some silk kerchiefs somewhere else. This little *meijd* then indeed went to Faustman and when she came back a moment thereafter, she told the testifier that Faustman did not want to return the aforementioned piece of money and had said to her that it must have been stolen, which is when the testifier went to Faustman herself in order to convince him of the contrary and to ask back the aforementioned piece of money; he then also said to her that it must have been stolen and for this reason he would send it to the honourable landdrost.

That thereupon the testifier went home and told all of the aforegoing to her owner, as also that what she was being accused of was absolutely untrue; to which he simply answered her that he did not wish to interfere with this, but that she herself could go to the landdrost to avow her innocence; as the testifier then indeed went there at once, when she, on his honour’s question of where she had obtained that money, came to answer, because of fear and ignorance, that she had got it from her aforementioned husband, which she now regrets having said, as she did not receive it from her husband but, as attested above, from the slave Sangoor.

There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of her statement as in the text, declaring this to be the whole truth.

Thus related at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch on 10 June 1791.

This mark X was set down by the testifier Rosetta with her own hand.

There appears before the undersigned deputised *heemraden*, the honourables Pieter Gerhard Wium and Christman Joël Ackerman, Sangoor van Macassar, 20 years old at a guess, bondsman of the burgher Hermanus Combrink, who on the requisition of the landdrost here, the honourable *koopman* Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, declares it to be true:

That some time ago, without being able to determine the correct day, a fellow slave of his owner, named Baatjoe, handed over to the deponent a piece of paper money which he said was five rixdollars, with the request to buy a blanket with it from the African[^3] *meijd* of the honourable Domus,[^4] whom the deponent does not know by name. And since he was just then going past the residence of the said honourable Domus on his way to fetch wood in the veld, he found the said woman slave there, which is when the deponent handed over the aforesaid piece of money, while saying that Baatjoe had sent him to buy blankets. The said slave accepted the piece of money and only told the deponent that she had no time to speak to him, whereupon she immediately went into the house.

There being nothing further to relate, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, declaring this to be the whole truth.

Thus recorded at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch on 10 June 1791.

This mark X was set down by the deponent with his own hand.

For the interpretation:

This mark X was set down by the *caffer* Meij, as interpreter, with his own hand.

[^1]: Paper money was new at the Cape, only becoming fully legal in 1782, *Kaapse Plakkaatboek* III: 134-36 (30 April 1782). See 1785 Spadilje van Siam and 1786 October van Madagascar et al. for other references.

[^2]: George Ernest Faustman became the messenger of the Stellenbosch landdrost in 1786 and died there the year after this case (Hoge 1946: 94).

[^3]: This did not have a racial connotation: Rosetta was ‘van de Caab’. By the 1790s, the word ‘African’ was being used to describe both slaves and settlers who were born at the Cape: by the late eighteenth century there was a growing creolised slave population. It is noteworthy that a slave who was not from the Cape noticed and described Rosetta in this way, perhaps an indication of the existence of different ethnic identities amongst slaves (compare 1763 Christina Strang, n. 6).

[^4]: Domus had been chief surgeon at the Cape until his retirement in 1787 (Leibbrandt 1905: 399 and 403-4).
