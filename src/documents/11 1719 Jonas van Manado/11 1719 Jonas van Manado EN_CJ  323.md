Today, 16 October 1719, there appears before me, Daniel Thibault, secretary of the honourable Council of Justice of this government, in the presence of the witnesses named below, Hermina Herwig of Amsterdam, widow of the late burgher here, Jan Basilius Creitsmar, who, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Cornelis van Beaumont, declares it to be true:

That on 20 August of this year, which was a Sunday, there came to the deponent in her bedroom her slave named Jonas van Balij,[^1] who requested her, seeing that it was a Sunday (and since this was always permitted him by his late *baas*), to be allowed to go out as per usual.

Which was allowed him by the deponent, it being then about three o’clock in the afternoon. That on the Monday, or the 21^st^ of the said month, three hours after noon, when she was in the attic of her residence, this slave Jonas came to her, handed over a certain document, and said: “There, *Juffrouw*”, without saying anything further.

That the deponent read the aforesaid document and understood the contents of it, from which she realised that this Jonas was requesting his freedom from her. Whereupon she asked him if his late *baas* had promised him this, who to this answered her in the negative, but \[said\] that the late Basilius had always told him: “I will do good to you”; to which the deponent replied that she would not give Jonas his freedom, since his *baas* had not promised it to him, to which this Jonas then answered: “Then I will not do good any longer”.

That after this, when they separated, this slave went the bark house.[^2] The deponent instantly followed him there, and after she searched his heart over his suggestion and utterances, while advising him to perform his duty as it ought to be done, this Jonas replied to this that he would not serve her as a slave, but as a faithful *knecht*, in which he had acquitted himself properly until the 13^th^ of this current month.

That at eight or nine o’clock in the evening of the aforesaid 13^th^, which was a Friday, when the deponent was sitting and eating at the table with her *knechten*, who are named Jan van Ees, Willem Mijn and Jan Smuts, she asked this Jonas, since the same did not want to eat, what was wrong with him, who answered to it: “Nothing at all”.

That after she had had her meal, the deponent, having no other thought than that the same slave Jonas had already, as was customary, gone to the attic to sleep, also betook herself, along with her four children, to bed.

That during the night, at about one o’clock, while a candle was burning in the room, one of her children, by the name of Catrijn, who was lying with two of her other children with her in bed, roused her and said: “Mother, Jonas is there”, whereupon she stuck her head through the curtains \[of the bed\], saw this Jonas, and asked the same: “Jonas, what are you doing here?”, at the same time rising up from the bed, when Jonas said to her: “Shh, *Juffrouw*”, whereupon he pulled an unsheathed knife from his pocket and stabbed against her chest, but since this did not have any effect, he tried to wound her with the knife on her neck or throat: upon which she grabbed the slave Jonas with the knife in his hand through which her hand became entangled with his in such a way, that he gave the deponent a wound with this knife on her right hand and also, during the struggle, a wound on her left hand.

That, on as many as two different occasions, the deponent tried to draw back the bolt of her bedroom door (with which it usually gets locked and also was, as per usual, locked at this time) but that this Jonas, during the struggle, shut it again every time until she finally managed to open the door while struggling and got to the *voorhuijs* with him where they fell over a planing bench, which was standing there; whereupon she roused her *knechten* with the calls: “Murder, murder” and: “*Knechten*, come and help me”, during which this slave pulled open the door, jumped over the lower \[half of the\] door and escaped in this way, without anybody yet having got to her at that moment.

That on Saturday evening, the fourteenth of this month, the deponent was warned by one of her slaves, named Claas, that the aforementioned Jonas was on the farm and that he had a knife in his hand, upon which she ordered her *knechten* to go and have a look, but when they arrived at the farm to look for him, they saw that he had jumped over the wall, whereupon the deponent had the *geweldiger* and the *caffers*[^3] called to see that this Jonas was apprehended, who did come, and that same evening, at about half past eight o’clock, they caught this slave Jonas – who had hid himself amongst the peas in the little garden behind her house – in the presence of her *knechten*, the *caffers* and slaves, and who then came into the hands of justice thus.

All of the aforesaid the deponent declares to be the whole and full truth, asserting to be convinced of the accuracy of her statement as in the text, while offering to subsequently confirm her deposition with solemn oaths, if so required.

Thus recorded at the Cape of Good Hope, in the presence of Pieter van der Heijden and Martinus Heems, clerks in the office of the Secretary of Justice, requested as witnesses hereto.

\[signed\] Harmina Herwegh, widow of Ian Basilis Kreijsmar \[*sic*\].

As witnesses, \[signed\] P. van der Heijden, Ms. Heems.

With my cognisance, \[signed\] Dl. Thibault, secretary.

**CJ 323** Criminele Process Stukken, 1719, f. 519 \[modern pagination\].

To the virtuous *juffrouw* Aarmintie Jillis,

Your honourable *juffrouw*’s[^4] obedient slave gives notice, with all humility and sadness of heart, with the presentation to your honourable *juffrouw* of how he, the suppliant, has served your honourable *juffrouw*, since fully ten years ago now, with faithful service, without complaining to anybody, consequently he, the suppliant, is finally seeking your honourable *juffrouw*’s aid with hands clasped and knees bent, praying humbly that it would please your honourable *juffrouw* to look upon him, the suppliant, in keeping with her[^5] innate mercifulness, with the eyes of compassion, and to please permit him, the suppliant, a letter of freedom. He, the suppliant, promises to serve your honourable *juffrouw* with faithful service.

Which I do, etc.

[^1]: Jonas is here described as ‘van Balij’ but in the *sententie* he is ‘van Manado’ (on the north-east coast of Sulawesi). Inconsistency in the use of slave toponyms in these records was not uncommon.

[^2]: At this time most cobblers at the Cape also acted as their own tanners (De Wet 1981: 69), and it is presumably for this reason that there was a small building on Kretschmar’s property where bark was kept. To prepare leather, raw hides were soaked over a long period in a solution of lime and so-called *run* (tan), which was made from the bark of oak trees (Buys 1769-1778, vol. 6: 510-12 and vol. 9: 250).

[^3]: The *caffers* were Company-owned slaves or convicts from the East who acted as the fiscal’s and executioner’s assistants and as policemen in the town. They enforced the curfew, both on slaves and on Company employees, Shell 1994: 189-94. They were much despised, not least because of their association with public executions, a role which in early modern Northern Europe conferred considerable dishonour, Stuart 1999. The *geweldiger* was the head of the *caffers* and was usually a European. For other cases with the *caffers* in action, see 1744 Barkat van Timor and 1757 Baatjoe van Mandhaar.

[^4]: This is a very literal translation. Scholtz (1963: 64-7 and 74-7) has shown that the eighteenth-century *UE.* (the abbreviation of ‘u Edele’, your honourable) developed into the formal Afrikaans second person pronoun *u*, and therefore the usage here might simply be an attempt to say: ‘you, *juffrouw*’, in the same way that Jonas refers to himself as ‘he, the suppliant’.

[^5]: The original has the male form of the pronoun, but it clearly has to refer to Jonas’s mistress. It is likely that this may reflect a feature of the sort of Dutch many slaves spoke, as the use of male pronouns for all genders is quite common in certain second-language varieties. For another example, see the sentence uttered by Claas in 1744 Claas van Bengalen and Augustus van Mallebaar.
