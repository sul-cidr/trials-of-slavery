Jonas made an appeal to his recently widowed owner to be set free. Manumission of slaves at the Cape was rare, but did sometimes take place by the wishes of an owner at the time of his or her death.[^1] Jonas presented his mistress with a letter requesting his freedom, which is reproduced here.[^2] He clearly believed that some form of written documentation would aid his request for manumission and probably requested his Sunday afternoon off[^3] in order to have it prepared for him by a letter-writer.[^4] However, his mistress refused him, a refusal which ultimately led to Jonas’s attempt to stab her in her bed several months later.

The case is also intriguing for the details of domestic life in an artisan household in the Cape.[^5] The presence of the many* knechten *doubtless led Jonas to make the intriguing assertion that he would be a faithful* knecht *to his owner if freed. Clearly he aspired to the status of the hired labourers in his owner’s home. Status, and the ways in which it was expressed, was crucially important in the VOC Cape.[^6]

[^1]: This was particularly the case when widows freed slaves after their husbands’ death, Elphick & Shell 1989: 208-9. On slave manumission during the eighteenth century in general, see Worden 1985: 143-45; Elphick & Shell 1989; and Shell 1994: 371-94.

[^2]: The documentation also includes the *eijsch* and the interrogation of Jonas, the substance of which was incorporated into the *sententie*, CJ 323, ff. 507-43.

[^3]: Slaves were supposed to have a rest day on Sundays, but it seems as if in practice only Company slaves could be sure of this, while privately owned slaves were dependent on the whims of their owners. See 1705 Cinna, n. 2.

[^4]: There is no evidence of who this might have been, but the style suggests that it was not somebody used to writing formal documents. For another case of slaves getting letters written for them by a burgher schoolchild, see 1786 Augustus van de Caab et al.
