# JONAS VAN MANADO

**CJ 784** Sententiën, 1717-1725, ff. 131-38.

As Jonas van Manado, 30 years old at a guess, bondsman of Hermina Herwigh, widow of Jan Basilius Creitsmar,[^1] currently their honours’ prisoner, has voluntarily confessed and admitted, without any torture or coercion of bonds, of irons, or any threat of suchlike; and since it has appeared most evident to the honourable Council of Justice:

That, in order to bring about his freedom, the prisoner, shortly after the passing away of his patron, the aforementioned Jan Basilius Kreitsmar, presented a petition to his said mistress in the attic of her home at 3 o’clock on the afternoon of August the 21^st^ of this year, by means of which he requested his freedom from her. That his mistress, having read this document, asked the prisoner if his *baas* had promised him such; to which the prisoner answered: “No”, but that his late master had always said to him: “I will do good to you”.

Upon which his aforementioned mistress replied that as long as she lived, she would not sell him, nor emancipate him. That the prisoner hereupon did not scruple to address her thus: “Then I will not do good any longer”, for which impudent words he was reprimanded by his mistress. On this occasion he also told her that he would not serve her as a slave, but as a faithful *knecht*.

That the prisoner, on the 13^th^ of the past month October, between 8 and 9 o’clock in the evening, was asked by his mistress, while she was sitting at the table eating with her *knechten*, if something was wrong with him that he would not eat, to which he answered (so he asserts) that he was a bit drunk. Whereupon the prisoner, after his mistress had eaten, instead of going to his usual sleeping place, dared to be so audacious as to hide himself in her bedroom under the bed, with the intention to steal.

That the prisoner kept himself hidden under that bed until midnight, which is when he got up from there and went to a table, upon which was a bottle of wine, and drank from this bottle. That while the prisoner was busy doing this, the little daughter of his mistress, by the name of Catrijn, woke up and, when she noticed the prisoner, roused her mother who, upon seeing the prisoner, asked him: “Jonas, what are you doing here?”, while at the same time rising from her bed. The prisoner went to her and said: “Hush, hush, *Juffrouw*, you must not call out”, whereupon, pulling out a knife from his pocket (to instil fear into her, as he asserts), he stabbed his mistress with it in the chest. Yet, since the stab was unsuccessful, his mistress grabbed him by the hand to prevent the prisoner from further evil, thereby wounding both her hands.

That while the prisoner was wrestling with his mistress, she drew back the bolt of the door and tried to escape, but the prisoner pushed the door shut again every time, until at last his mistress, after a lengthy struggle, got the door open, and came falling over the planing bench into the *voorhuijs* with the prisoner, at which she called out: “Murder, murder” and “*Knechten*, come and help me!”, while the prisoner pulled the front door open and fled, with the knife in his hand (which was shown to him in court), from the house towards Table Mountain.

However, that the prisoner, after having committed this gross crime, did not fear nor scruple to return to the farm of his mistress the following evening – this time (as he asserts) having the knife in his pocket – in order to sleep there, with the intention to once again flee to the mountain the following morning, and thus he fell into the hands of justice.

All of which is public and murderous violence, committed during night-time by an armed slave against his defenceless mistress in her locked bedroom, and therefore matters of very serious and pernicious consequences and in all countries punishable to the utmost; accordingly, in a country where justice is administered properly, it may not be tolerated, but should be restrained and punished most severely, as an example and deterrent to all such inclined villains.

Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice of this government, serving today, having seen and read the written *crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie*, deliberated by the honourable independent fiscal, Cornelis van Beaumont, in his official capacity, against the prisoner, with the further papers and documents serving as evidence of his audacity; and moreover, having pondered everything which in any way served the case and which could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the free United Netherlands, and having judged the prisoner, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the place where criminal justice is usually executed here, and there to be handed over to the executioner, first that his right hand be chopped off and then, with the same \[severed hand\] and a knife above his head,[^2] to be punished with the rope on the gallows so that death will follow; afterwards that the dead body be taken from there, dragged through their honours’ streets and roads to the outer place of execution, there to be hanged again with the severed hand and the knife above the head, and to remain like that until being consumed by the air and birds of heaven; with the costs and expenditure of justice.[^3]

Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 23 November 1719.

Published and executed on the 25^th^ thereupon.

\[signed\] M.P. Chavonnes, A. Cranendronk, K.J. Slotsboo, Jan de la Fontaine, A. v. Kervel, J. Aldersz, Clis. Barents, C. Valk, G. v. Baarsenburg, M. Bergstedt.

In my presence, \[signed\] Dl. Thibault, secretary.

[^1]: Johann Basilius Kretschmar, who died shortly before this incident, operated as a cobbler, which explains why there were so many *knechten* in the household. His widow, Hermina Herwigh, married one of them, Anton Martens, the year after this case (Hoge 1944: 220 and 259).

[^2]: A gruesomely appropriate punishment for a slave who had threatened his owner with a knife.

[^3]: This sentence (which was recorded in the *regtsrollen*, CJ 7, ff. 69-70) was somewhat reduced from the recommendation of the *eijsch*, that Jonas be broken alive on the cross, CJ 323, f. 515-16.
