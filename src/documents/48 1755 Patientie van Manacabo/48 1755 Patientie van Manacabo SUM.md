# PATIENTIE VAN MANACABO AND DECEMBER VAN BOEGIES

*This is a case of two Cape Town slaves who stole guns and ammunition from their owners and ran away.[^1] They survived in the False Bay area with the aid of a slave shepherd who brought them food. They were seen by a Company soldier, who was subdued by their brandishing their guns at him, but were eventually caught when one of them decided to sell his coat for food in Cape Town, while the other was apprehended by the Company slaves of the False Bay outpost at Simonâ€™s Bay. The case again demonstrates the difficulties of survival for runaway slaves in the (relatively) settled regions of the colony and graphically illustrates the obsessive fear Cape society had of armed and uncontrolled slaves.[^2]*
