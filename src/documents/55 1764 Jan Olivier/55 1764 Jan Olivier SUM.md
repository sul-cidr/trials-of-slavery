# JAN OLIVIER

*This is a case of a slave who decided to give up on his escape bid and asked another farmer to put in a good word for him with his owner to avoid punishment. He was returned, but died several days later, according to his owner’s report, because of a throat swelling. Although the circumstances were suspicious, nothing was done at the time. It is not clear why this case was brought up again over two years later, but it was not forwarded to the Council of Justice and no action seems to have been taken against Olivier.[^1]*

*Note that while the slave Jas was at Pretorius’s farm for only a day, he was made to help with the fieldwork – the presence of additional labour was always welcome.*

[^1]: There is no record of the case in the *regtsrollen* or the volumes of documents in criminal cases of the Council of Justice for 1764, CJ 46 and CJ 381-83.
