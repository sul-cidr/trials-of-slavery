# JAN OLIVIER

**1/STB 3/11** Criminele Verklaringen, 1759-1782, unpaginated.

Today, 25 January 1764, there appears before me, Abraham Faure, secretary of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the burgher Jan Lodewijk Pretorius, of competent age, who, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, *Meester* Jacobus Johannes le Suëur, declares it to be the truth:

That in the year 1761,[^1] during the months of June or July – while the deponent has forgotten the exact date, he seems, however, to think that it was about this time of the year, and indeed on a Friday evening – there arrived on the deponent’s home farm in the Land van Waveren, a certain slave of his fellow burgher, Jan Gijsbert Olivier, named Jas, who had some days before fled from his owner’s farm and who requested the deponent to put in a good word for him with his owner so that he might not get a beating, which the deponent also promised him and then ordered him to remain there for that night. That on the following day, as the deponent was busy ploughing and therefore could not take the said slave home, he took the same with him to the fields and used him to help spread the manure, while in the meantime the deponent had let the aforesaid Olivier know that the said slave was to be found there, whereupon Olivier then also came to this farm and was requested by the deponent to pardon his said slave, to which the same answered: “Yes”, promising that he would not punish him; further that the aforementioned Olivier had ordered the said slave to go home, who thereupon departed, and who was shortly thereafter followed by the said Olivier.

That, on the deponent’s estimate, on the third day thereafter, when he was ready to ride to the burgher Pieter te Bruin, the aforesaid Olivier, who was coming from his mother-in-law, the widow of Jacques Therond, stopped by and asked the deponent if he would ride with him to his farm, adding that the aforesaid slave Jas, who the previous evening had complained about a sore throat, had suddenly died that morning. Whereupon the deponent rode along and arrived at the farm of Olivier, where there also arrived, shortly thereafter, one Jacob Pietersz, living with the widow Therond. That the deponent then, together with the aforementioned Pietersz, at the request of the said Olivier, inspected the corpse of the aforementioned slave Jas, lying in the wagonhouse, and could not discern that the said slave had received even the least wound, having seen on the dead body nothing but a small swelling on the neck, which appeared to be just like a swollen gland. The deponent declares further to have understood at that time from the wife of said Oliver that on that very same morning she had given the aforesaid slave some brandy with pepper to gurgle, who then went from the house to the aforementioned wagonhouse and shortly thereafter died.

The deponent finally declares as well, that on the same day the aforementioned Jan Gijsbert Olivier gave a proper report of the said death to the then honourable landdrost in a short letter signed by the deponent and the aforesaid Jacob Pietersz.[^2]

There being nothing further to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his deposition as in the text, being willing to subsequently confirm this, his deposition, with solemn oaths, if so required.

Thus recorded at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch in the presence of the messenger of the court Johan Martin Smalberger and the beadle Coenraad Fick, as witnesses.

Today, 1 February 1764, there appears before me, Abraham Faure, secretary of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the arquebusier[^3] Jacob Pietersz, who is on loan to and currently living with the burgher Jacob Mouton, being of competent age, who, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, *Meester* Jacobus Johannes le Suëur, declares it to be true:

That during the month of June or July, while the exact date has slipped his mind, of the year 1761, when the deponent was living as schoolteacher[^4] with the widow of Jacques Therond in the Land van Waveren, there arrived the burgher Jan Gijsbert Olivier who requested the deponent to come to his farm in order to inspect a certain slave of his, by the name of Jas, who had complained about a sore throat and who suddenly died that morning. The deponent then, after the said Olivier had already departed, set out to that place and when he arrived there, he also found there the burgher Jan Lodewijk Pretorius.

That the deponent then, at the request of the aforementioned Olivier, went with the said Pretorius to the wagonhouse where the corpse of the said slave Jas was lying on its back in the front of the room and, having inspected the same, he could not notice the least wound on the head of the dead slave, except for a small swelling showing on the neck.

That at the same time the deponent understood from the wife of the said Olivier that, on that very same morning, she had given the aforementioned slave Jas, who was still complaining over the pain in his throat, some brandy with pepper with which to gurgle, who took it and went to the wagonhouse but died shortly thereupon.

The deponent further declares that, at the request of Olivier, he had written on that very same day a short letter to the then honourable landdrost Van Schoor, serving as a report of the above, which letter was signed by the said Olivier, as well as by the deponent and the aforesaid Jan Lodewijk Pretorius.

There being nothing further to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his deposition as in the text, being willing to subsequently confirm this, his deposition, with solemn oaths, if so required.

Thus recorded at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch in the presence of the messenger of the court Johan Martin Smalberger and the beadle Coenraad Fick, as witnesses.

[^1]: Note that these testimonies were taken two and half years after the events in question. It may have been that suspicion about Olivier was only then reported to the landdrost, but there is no evidence in the archive of this and the case does not appear to have been taken further.

[^2]: For the requirement to give reports of unnatural slave deaths, see 1718 Anthonij van Mallabaar, n. 3. This is explicitly stated here by Pretorius to make clear that there was nothing suspicious about this death. For cases where owners omitted to give such reports, see 1750 David van Bengalen and 1763 Christina Strang.

[^3]: The term for a soldier trained to shoot with an arquebus, see 1707 Jan de Thuilot, n. 11.

[^4]: *Knechten* were sometimes used as teachers on farms (Shell 1994: 19-20), although their role was more commonly that of overseer or labourer (see 1761 Johan Spring in ’t Veld, n. 1).
