# JEPHTA VAN MADAGASCAR

**1/STB 3/11** Criminele Verklaringen, 1759-1782, unpaginated.

Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Marthinus Adrianus Bergh, by the slave Carolina van Madagascar, of competent age, belonging to the burgher Pieter de Villiers Abramsz, of the following content:

That during the forenoon on Sunday of the previous week, when her mistress had ordered the slave Jephta van Madagascar to go and collect some cabbages on the farm of the former *heemraad*, *Monsieur* Jacobus Conterman, the same said, while turning around and leaving the kitchen: “Your *moer*,[^1] can’t another *jongen* go to collect the cabbages! I have to plant my onions”,[^2] which the testifier, who was at this time alone in that room, heard very clearly. That the said Jephta then departed and again got home at midday with some cabbage in a bag; that in the afternoon the testifier’s mistress herself prepared a pot full of cabbage and handed it over to the testifier to cook and, after having been occupied with this, she went outside to fetch water and, when the testifier came back into the kitchen, she saw the aforesaid Jephta (who in the meantime had come into the house) holding the lid of the pot in his hands and instantly setting it back, and when she asked him what he was doing there by the pot, he answered that the pot of cabbage was boiling rapidly and that he therefore took care of it, after which he again went outside. That thereupon the testifier, while stirring the aforementioned stewing cabbage, saw the head of a snake in the pot, which she immediately made known to her mistress; whereupon her owner and his wife, after they too had looked at this snake-head in the pot, took the said pot with everything that was in it from the kitchen and stowed it away. That the following morning, when Jephta was interrogated by their owner about this in her presence and the testifier reproached him for the above, the same said that he did not place the snake-head in the pot, notwithstanding the testifier’s testimony that on that afternoon nobody but the aforementioned slave Jephta had been in the kitchen.

There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of her statement as in the text, being willing, if so required, to subsequently confirm the above.

Thus related at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch on 6 November 1775 in the presence of the beadle Johannes Jacobus Reiniers and the burgher Johannes Victor, requested as witnesses hereto.

This mark X was set down by the slave Carolina with her own hand.

Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Marthinus Adrianus Bergh, by the burgher Pieter de Villiers Abramsz, of competent age, which is of the following content, namely:

That during the afternoon of Sunday, the 29^th^ of the just passed month October, when his wife had prepared a pot of cabbage for the evening meal and had let the same be hung over the fire to cook by his slave Carolina van Madagascar, a short while thereafter, at sunset, the said slave came to her mistress and said that, after she had left the kitchen to the outside to fetch water and again came in, she saw that the slave Jephta van Madagascar (who in the meantime had gone in there) had the lid of the aforementioned pot in his hands and then instantly set it on the pot again, whereupon Carolina asked him what he was doing there, and received as answer that he thought that the pot would boil over and therefore lifted the lid, after which he again went outside. That next Carolina, while stirring this food, found the head of a snake in the pot.

Upon which his wife investigated this and informed him thereof, whereupon he took the aforementioned pot from the fire and found in it the head of a snake with a small part \[of its body\]. That the testifier had the pot with its contents stowed away, without revealing anything of it to the said Jephta that evening, until the following morning when Jephta returned from his work and on his own initiative said to the testifier: “*Baas*, the *meijd* makes it so, is it right that she does so!”, whereupon the testifier tied him up, took him to the aforementioned pot, and asked him if he did not place the aforementioned poison in it himself. This was denied by him, while he again answered little to what the aforementioned Carolina said (who related the above to the testifier in his presence), saying only that he did not do it. Which is why the testifier brought the aforementioned slave Jephta here under arrest for further investigation of this case.

There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing, if so required, to subsequently confirm the above with solemn oaths.

Thus related at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch on 6 November 1775 in the presence of the messenger of the court Morits Herman Otto Woeke and the beadle Johannes Jacobus Reiniers, requested as witnesses hereto.

[^1]: The word *moer* is a contraction of Dutch *moeder* and literally means ‘mother’, but was used as a fairly common swearing word at the Cape (Scholtz 1972: 143) and still is today. There seems to be no English equivalent to express the force of this curse.

[^2]: Jephta may have meant by this that he wanted to plant onions in his own garden. See 1770 Jephta van de Caab, n. 1 for slave gardens. It may also be significant that this took place on a Sunday, when he might have expected to be given free time: for this, see 1705 Cinna, n. 2.
