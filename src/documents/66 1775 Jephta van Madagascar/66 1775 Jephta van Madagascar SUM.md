# JEPHTA VAN MADAGASCAR

*Jephta tried to poison his mistressâ€™s cooking pot by placing a snake head in it.[^1] This was a specific retaliation since he resented having to fetch ingredients for her from a neighbouring farm on a Sunday, and not a sign of general slave resistance. When the head was found, he tried to transfer the blame onto Carolina, his fellow Malagasy slave cook.[^2]*

[^1]: For another case of attempted slave poisoning, see 1754 Rachel van de Caab. For the reputation of slaves (especially females) as poisoners, see Penn 1999: 44.

[^2]: The case was not sent to the Council of Justice. It is possible that since only Carolina could provide somewhat ambiguous evidence against Jephta, it was dismissed by the Stellenbosch landdrost.
