# APRIL VAN DE CAAB

**CJ 788** Sententiën, 1750-1755, ff. 103-8

Since April van de Caab, bondsman of the farmer Pieter Therron \[*sic*\], 20 years old at a guess, currently their honours’ prisoner, has voluntarily confessed, without any torture or coercion of bonds, of irons, or even the least threat of suchlike, and since it has also come to appear evident to the honourable Council of Justice of this government:

That the prisoner, now almost three months ago, fled from his master and, after wandering about for some time, got to the farm of the farmer Jan Smit, situated at the Honingberg, where the prisoner, as he was unknown to everybody, passed himself off as a *Bastaard Hottentot*. Yet, some time hereafter, he was recognised by the Hottentot Willem and taken prisoner on the farm of the said Jan Smit by him and his brother Jantje, as well as three other Hottentots, all resident with the farmer Lourens Pretorius, and taken to the farm of the said Pretorius, from where the aforesaid Hottentots Willem and Jantje then, on the order of the aforesaid Pretorius, took away the trussed prisoner the following day in order to return him home again to his master, resident at Roodesant. However, having met the shepherd of the farmer Gerrit van Hoeting, by the name of Fortuijn van Boegies, in the afternoon in the kloof of Roodesant, the aforementioned Willem said: “Let us ask for a piece of bread here, I am hungry”. After requesting this, Willem, as well as the said Jantje and the prisoner, each got a piece of bread and meat from the aforesaid Fortuijn and, after having scraped off the mould from the bread with a knife and after they had finished their meal, the aforementioned Willem filled a pipe with tobacco. While doing so, the prisoner, who was sitting close to the aforesaid shepherd and had asked him in Malay[^1] for a knife to cut the bread with, and after having received the knife from him, said: “There is a wagon, but it is riding off the road”, which was denied by the said Willem and Jantje, who claimed that the wagon was not off but actually on the road, and about which they argued with him. The prisoner, who was standing up, thereupon pretended to be sitting down again, which is when – after he had cut loose the rope with which he was tied up while they were talking – he unexpectedly, saying: “Hey!”, gave the Hottentot Willem, who was sitting flat on the ground, a stab in his left side under his chest; and then, leaving the knife sticking from the wound, took flight, being pursued by the shepherd Fortuijn after the latter had first taken out the knife from the body of the Hottentot, without being able to catch up with the prisoner. After which the aforesaid Hottentot Willem, after being taken to the farm of the farmer Gerrit van Hoeting with the help of two of his slaves and being bandaged by the farmer August Willem Eens, as well as he could, passed away in the afternoon of the following day.

The prisoner, after having roamed around for some days, was finally apprehended and thus fell into the hands of justice.

All of which is an abominable affair, which cannot be, nor should be, tolerated in a well-established government, but on the contrary ought to be punished as an example and deterrent to other similar scoundrels.

Wherefore it is, that the aforementioned honourable Council of Justice, serving today, having read and considered with care the written *crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie* drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoner by the landdrost of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, *Sieur* Adriaan van Schoor, in his official capacity, as well as having noted the prisoner’s voluntary confession and the other documents added to it, all properly verified in court, and everything further that served the case and could possibly have moved their honours; practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the United Netherlands as well as his illustrious highness, the Lord Prince of Orange and Nassau, as hereditary Stadtholder, Captain and Admiral General of the Republic, and having judged the prisoner April van de Caab, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the place where criminal sentences are usually executed here, there to be handed over to the executioner, and to be punished with the rope on the gallows so that death will follow; further that his dead body be dragged to the outer place of execution and there, yet again, hanged upon the gallows, to remain thus until being consumed by the air and the birds of heaven, with sentencing to the costs and expenditure of justice.[^2]

Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 8 June 1752, as well as pronounced and executed on the 10^th^ thereupon.

Let the sentence be done, \[signed\] R. Tulbagh.

[^1]: An interesting indication that a locally born slave knew (some) Malay and could therefore communicate with a slave from the Indonesian archipelago. On the use of Malay as a contact language between slaves, along with Creole Portuguese, see 1775 Moses van de Caab.

[^2]: This was the sentence recommended in the *eijsch*, CJ 360, f. 242. At his sentencing, April van de Caab claimed that he had not intended to kill Willem. He was nonetheless found guilty of murder and sentenced as above, CJ 34, ff. 43-5.
