Statement given on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Marthinus Adrianus Bergh, by the *veldcorporaal* Gerrit Smit, of competent age, being of the following contents, namely:

That on Tuesday, the 2^nd^ of this month, when the testifier discovered in the morning that the mill on his farm, the Drogerijscloof, situated behind Piketberg, had been broken into during the night, and that two *mudden* flour had been spilled on the floor and that both bags with some flour had been taken away, the testifier and the burgher Gideon van Zijl Pz., who was outspanning at his place, together with a Hottentot named Jan, searched around on his farm and when they discovered some traces of barefooted people,[^1] he and the said Van Zijl, each armed with a loaded gun, followed the said traces, together with the said Hottentot Jan and a certain Bastaard named Gerrit, the last mentioned of which only had a *kirrij* with him. When they, about half an hour from the farm of the testifier, saw some clothes lying by the bushes next to the river and, coming closer, discovered four *jongens* who were lying there in the bushes, the testifier instantly called out to them that they should come out, whereupon they proceeded to stand in a row before the bushes, with one of them having an unsheathed cutlass in the one hand and a knife in the other, and similarly one of the other two unsheathed knives, and both the others each holding one of the same in the hand. Hereupon the testifier repeatedly called to them that they should throw down their knives and should come to him one by one, upon which the said four *jongens* spoke in Malay, which the testifier could not understand, and who told them in Portuguese yet again that they should throw down their knives and should come to him. They then, without however getting rid of their knives and cutlass, rushed towards to the testifier, who thereupon told them to stay back, repeating that they should first throw down their knives, whereupon they stood still, while the testifier again repeated what he said before and threatened to shoot at them if they would not throw down their knives. As they still did not do so, the testifier then told the aforementioned Van Zijl that he should just as well shoot one of these slaves in the legs as a result of which they would no doubt give themselves up as prisoners. Which was done by the said Van Zijl but when the shot *jongen* fell down to the ground, the other three came running with their knives, shouting: “Amok! Amok! Matta Garra!”,[^2] towards the said Van Zijl who, as his gun was not loaded, then took flight, while the testifier then hit one of these deserters, who was closest behind Van Zijl, with a shot from his gun in such a way that the same instantly fell down dead to the ground, while the remaining two then ran to the testifier (who had not yet loaded his gun), and followed him for approximately 150 paces, after which they again went back to their previous place in the bushes. In the meantime, the testifier and Van Zijl loaded their guns and followed the said two *jongens*, when the said Van Zijl shot at one of them but did not hit him, whereupon the testifier shot the same one – who did not want to throw down his knife and, while shouting: “Bie, bie”,[^3] stormed towards him, while the testifier again retreated and again called to him to throw down his knife and to give himself up as prisoner – with a bullet through his body, in such a way that he immediately fell down, and when the same again tried, in vain, to lift himself up, he died at once with the knife in his hand. After which the fourth of them, on the order of the testifier, then threw down his knife and gave himself up as prisoner. The testifier also found in the aforesaid bush half a *mud* of the flour that they had stolen the previous night, and understood from the latter that they were bondsmen of the *fabriek[^4] * at the Cape of Good Hope.

There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the certainty of the statement as given in the text, being willing, if so required, to subsequently confirm the above with solemn oaths.

Thus recorded in the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch on 8 May 1775, in the presence of the messenger of the court Morits Herman Otto Woeke and the burgher Johannes Engel, as witnesses.

Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Marthinus Adrianus Bergh, by the slave Maart van Bencoule, of competent age, belonging to the *fabricq*, *Monsieur* Marthinus van Oorden, being of the following contents, namely:

That some time after the testifier had run away with three of his fellow slaves by the name of Pallas, Julij and Kuijper from their owner in the Cape, having been enticed thereto by the slave Pallas, and taking with them six knives and a cutlass; they went to a certain mountain, which the testifier cannot name, and when they were sleeping there, they were roused by four people, consisting of two Dutchmen[^5] who had guns with them, and two Hottentots armed with *assegaaijen*. Whereupon they each got up, holding a knife in their hand, but, while the testifier was still rubbing his eyes, he was hit with a shot in his leg so that he immediately fell down, without being able to tell whether the other slaves had defended themselves nor if they had chased the Dutchmen.

There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the certainty of the statement as given in the text, being willing, if so required, to subsequently confirm the above.

Thus recorded, and interpreted from Malay by the first mentioned testifier, in Stellenbosch on 30 May 1775, in the presence of the burghers Johannes Victor and Johs. Jacobus Reiniers, requested as witnesses hereto.

This X mark was set down by the slave Maart with his own hand.

Today, 14 June 1775, there appears before me, Abraham Faure, secretary of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the Hottentot Jan, of competent age, who, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Marthinus Adrianus Bergh, declares it to be true:

That the deponent is hired by the burgher Johs. Erasmus Smit and that some time ago, the *veldcorporaal* Gerrit Smit had asked the said Johs. Er. Smit for the deponent in order to search for the tracks of some deserters who had stolen from him. The deponent then, on the order of his *baas*, did this in the veld and, when he found the tracks, he followed them with the said *veldcorporaal* and Gideon van Zijl, as well as the *Bastaard* Gerrit, until they got in the vicinity of a dry river where four deserters were lying in the bushes, who, when they were called by the the *veldcorporaal* and told that they should give themselves up as prisoners, came forward with unsheathed knives in their hands, when the deponent (who did not have anything with him but a thin cane) sped to the river in order to find a suitable stick. When the deponent heard a shot going off, turned around and saw that the aforesaid *jongens* were running after Van Zijl, when one of them was thereupon shot dead by the *veldcorporaal*, while the deponent picked up a stick and came forwards with it. The two remaining *jongens* chased after the *veldcorporaal* with their unsheathed knives, but turned around and then took flight across the aforementioned river, which is where the *veldcorporaal* shot dead another one who ran towards him, while the other one eventually gave himself up.

There being nothing further to relate, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the certainty of his statement as given in the text, being willing, if so required, to subsequently confirm the above.

Thus recorded at the secretary’s office in Stellenbosch in the presence of the messenger of the court Morits Herman Otto Woeke and the beadle Johannes Jacobus Reiniers, as witnesses.

This mark X was set down by the Hottentot Jan with his own hand.

As witnesses, \[signed\] M.H.O. Woeke, J.J. Reiniers.

[^2]: This utterance, and the one which follows, not only illustrate how these slaves could communicate in both Malay and Portuguese, but also, as pointed out by den Besten, how often dialectical or substandard forms of an unknown language were misunderstood at the Cape: *Amok* is Malay for ‘attack’, *matta* is Creole Portuguese for ‘kill’, but *gara* poses a problem, as the form which Smit, who knew no Malay, heard and reported to the judicial authorities (who left us the only trace of it) is not known in either language. Den Besten suggests it is the Eastern Malay form of *gorok* (in which dialect the final consonant gets deleted), meaning ‘to slash somebody’s throat, to butcher’. This utterance can therefore be translated as: “Attack! Attack! Kill! Slash!” (Den Besten 2004: 89-90).

[^3]: Creole Portuguese for “Come, come” (Den Besten 2004: 90).

[^4]: It was common in the eighteenth century to refer to somebody by a shortened version of their job title. *Fabriek* probably refers in this way to the *fabriekmeester,* the head of the Company public works. Martinus van Oorden had arrived at the Cape in 1773 and was appointed supervisor for the building of the new Company hospital, in charge of 89 builders (VOC 5222, f. 65 and VOC 6576, f. 197). The slaves appear to have been his personal property, not the Company slaves who worked in the warehouses.
