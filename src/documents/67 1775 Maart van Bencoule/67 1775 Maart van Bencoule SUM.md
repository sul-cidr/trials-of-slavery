# MAART VAN BENCOULE

*This incident of the tracking down, shooting and capturing of a group of Cape Town runaway slaves who had raided a farm in the Piketberg, is primarily of interest for what it reveals about the linguistic complexity of the Cape as late as the 1770s.[^1] Whereas in the previous case communication problems arose because of the variety of languages spoken amongst the slaves, this one illustrates how slaves were linguistically differentiated from the settlers. The runaways, who were all slaves from the East Indies, spoke Malay to one another, which the farmers and Khoi who apprehended them could not understand, although they attempted to communicate with them in Portuguese.[^2]*

*The slaves tried to run* amok,[^3] *but were shot or captured before they could attack any of their pursuers. Two were killed, while Maart van Bencoule[^4] and Kuijper van Macassar were captured and questioned.[^5] However, the case against them was not forwarded to the Court of Justice and it is not known how they were punished.[^6] Also of interest is the farmers’ use of the Khoi Jan as a tracker to locate the barefooted runaways.*

[^1]: The case is mentioned in Penn 1999: 91. For discussion of the linguistic complexity of Cape slave society, see also 1763 Christina Strang and 1775 Moses van Bengalen.

[^2]: It is significant that while the farmer is capable of addressing them in Portuguese, he does not understand Malay. Although no detailed study of this has yet been done, it seems from the available evidence that Portuguese was more commonly used as a lingua franca amongst the slaves and that settlers were more likely to know this language than Malay (see, for example, the data in Franken 1953: 41-79). Although these slaves ignored the farmer’s questions, they undoubtedly knew some Portuguese, as is confirmed by their utterances, which are in both these languages.

[^3]: See 1744 Barkat van Timor for this phenomenon. As in *amok* cases, one of them wanted to commit suicide.

[^4]: Bencoule (present-day Bengkulu) on the western coast of Sumatra. The port was an English East India Company trading post from the late seventeenth century, although it was largely unsuccessful in tapping into the VOC-dominated trade in the East Indies and it faded into insignificance after the founding of Singapore in 1819.

[^5]: In addition to those transcribed here, the testimonies collected by the Stellenbsoch landdrost included those of Kuijper van Macassar, Gideon van Zijl and the *Bastaard-Hottentot* Gerrit Obie, 1/STB 3/11, unpaginated.

[^6]: There is no record of the case in the *regtsrollen*, CJ 57.
