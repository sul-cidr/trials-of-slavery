# ANTHONIJ

**1/STB 18/157** Notariële Verklaringen, 1715-1720, unpaginated.

Today, 6 February in the year 1715, there appears before me, Ernst Fredrik de Swart, secretary of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein etc., in the presence of the witnesses named below, the burgher Jacob Mundes, who, on the requisition of the burgher and surgeon Dirk Snith, declares it to be true and truthful:

That on 3 November 1714, he saw the petitioner’s wife coming on horseback from Stellenbosch on her way to the petitioner’s farm, situated about an hour from Stellenbosch, having on the back of the horse a slave named Anthonij, which the sick comforter Jan Mahieu had sold that same day to the petitioner. The deponent asked the wife of the petitioner why she had taken the slave with her on the horse and did not let him go up by foot, who answered that the said slave was so feeble and weak that he could not walk so far, but added to this: “As long as nothing is the matter with him but scrawniness and feebleness, I will soon put him right and fatten him”. Thereupon, on the following day, the aforementioned slave Anthonij came to the deponent on the post of the former *heemraad* Jan Botma, where the deponent was assigned as *knecht*, and complained to him, the deponent, that he was incapable of doing any work, since he had been sickly for quite a while now. The deponent also wanted to give the aforenamed slave Anthonij a piece of food, but he would not accept it, saying: “*Sinjeur*, I cannot eat, I have too much pain in my chest.”

The deponent declares nothing further, but asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his testimony as given in the text, while offering to subsequently confirm the same with oaths, if need be, and if so requested.

Thus recorded in the secretary’s office in Stellenbosch, in the presence of the beadle Bastiaan Cevaal and the burgher Roeloff Joonasse, requested as witnesses hereto.

With my cognisance, \[signed\] E. Fk. de Swart, secretary.

Today, 6 February in the year 1715, there appear before me, Ernst Fredrik de Swart, secretary of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein etc., in the presence of the witnesses named below, Margarita Coenen, widow of the former secretary Jan Swart, and Eliesabeth \[*sic*\] Jansz, wife of the burgher Hendrik Loos, who, on the requisition of the burgher and surgeon Dirk Snidt \[*sic*\], declare the following:

Firstly, the first deponent, Margarita Coenen, declares that she, without being able to remember the exact day, was called by a slave of the sick comforter Jan Mahieu, asking if she would please come over, while saying: “Antoonij is dying”. The deponent went over and when she got there, she declares that, seeing the said slave Antonij lying in a swoon, she immediately sent for his master, the aforementioned Mahieu, who, at that time, was at the house of the surgeon Daniel Pfeijl, and who also instantly arrived there together. Seeing the said slave Anthoonij still in that state, the said surgeon Pfeijl gave the aforementioned slave Antonij one or two slaps in the face, when he rose up and asked: “*Sinjeur*, what do you wish?”; yet she, the deponent, does not know what this illness was.

Further, the second deponent, Eliesabeth, declares that the aforementioned slave Anthoonij, during the time that he had still been with the sick comforter Jan Mahieu, was sickly most of the time, although she does not know what exactly had been his ailment.

The deponents declare nothing further, but assert to be convinced of the accuracy of their testimonies as given in the text, being willing, at all times, if need be and if so requested, to confirm the same with oaths.

Thus done and recorded in the secretary’s office in Stellenbosch, in the presence of the beadle Bastiaan \[*sic*\] Cevaal and the burgher Roloff Joonasse \[*sic*\], requested as witnesses hereto.

This X is the mark of Margarita Coenen.
