Thursday, 20 April 1752, in the morning, present the honourable Isack Meinertzhagen and all the members, except the honourable lord president Sergius Swellengrebel and the honourable Hendrik Ruiter, because of their occupations, besides the honourable Willem van Kerckhoff, through indisposition.

The honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, in his official capacity, as *eijscher*,

contra:

Jacob van de Caab, currently their honours’ prisoner and defendant in this case, because he did not scruple to brazenly leave his owner, the bookkeeper and sworn clerk of the Orphan Chamber[^1] here, Monsieur Philip Herman Boomgaard, and, during the month of June of the previous year 1751, to flee on the ship the Gouverneur Generaal[^2] from here to the fatherland, where he remained until he recently arrived here again as \[ship’s\] boy under the name of Jacobus Claasz of the Cape of Good Hope on the ship Brouwer,[^3] whereupon he was delivered into the hands of justice.

The honourable *eijscher*, having delivered his action orally, to the purport of what is mentioned in the annexed presentation \[i.e. *eijsch*\], demands that, with certain judgment by your honours, the defendant in this be severely whipped by the *caffers*, further to be put into chains for a period of two successive years, to be sent home thus to his owner, provided he pays the costs.

The defendant gives as answer that during the month of June of the previous year, when his owner was not at the Cape, he went to the beach to get sand, where he was persuaded by the boatsmen of the ship the Gouverneur Generaal to go with them aboard their ship, which he did, without later being able to come on shore again.

The honourable *eijscher*, rejecting the defendant’s claim as frivolous and insufficient, persists with his *eijsch ende conclusie* as rejoinder.

The defendant rejoins with a request for forgiveness.

The parties renounce producing any further evidence.

The Council, after considering the case, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the United Netherlands, as well as his most serene highness, the Lord Prince of Orange and Nassou, as hereditary Stadholder, Captain and Admiral General of the Republic, sentences the defendant, Jacob van de Caab, after first having been tied to a stake, to be thoroughly whipped by the *caffers*, further to be riveted in chains for a period of two successive years, to be sent home thus to his owner, provided he pays the costs.

In the Castle of Good Hope, the date as above.

In my presence, \[signed\] Jn. Fr. Tiemmendorf, secretary.

[^2]: Gouverneur Generaal belonged to the Chamber of Delft and stopped in Cape Town on its way back from Batavia from 9 to 27 May 1751. Some 40 sailors had died on the voyage and Jacob was doubtless welcomed as one of the 26 new men that were taken on at the Cape, Bruijn et al. 1979, vol. III: 398-99.

[^3]: Brouwer belonged to the Chamber of Enkhuizen and sailed from Texel on 19 December 1751, arriving at the Cape on 11 April 1752, after a brief stay in Santiago. The ship was also found to contain two women dressed as soldiers, Bruijn et al. 1979, vol. II: 536-37. There is no record of Jacobus Claasz, in the *scheepsoldijboek* of the Brouwer (VOC 13993) but this might be explained by the fact that employees with the toponym ‘van de Caab’ were not listed in the muster rolls with the names of incoming ship registers.
