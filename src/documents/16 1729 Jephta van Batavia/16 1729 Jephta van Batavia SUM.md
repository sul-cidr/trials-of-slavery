# JEPHTA VAN BATAVIA

*This case of jealousy by a male slave over a female slave with whom he had previously had a relationship, leading to him stabbing her, shows how slaves, despite their unfree status, still managed to have emotional relationships and contacts with other slaves. It thus gives a rare glimpse into the world of the slaves which existed alongside that of their owners. The case is striking for the strong expression of Jephta’s emotions, he declaring that he wanted her death even though he might be broken on the wheel for it. Jephta’s owner[^1] was not prepared to pay the costs of the trial, and was willing to relinquish this troublesome slave to the Company, which was glad to accept a ‘healthy’ slave convict labourer.[^2]*

[^1]: Johannes Heufke, a member of the Cape burgher elite, who obtained part of the monopolies to sell brandy and Cape wine every year between 1726 and 1731. From other documentation (CJ 333, ff. 295-96) we know that he did not operate a tavern from his own house at the time of this case, but it certainly served, as with many of the other *pachters*, as a warehouse for his alcohol, hence Jephta’s being able to drink himself into a stupor there. On Heufke, see Hoge 1946: 157.
