This example of slave arson targeted the house of a farmer who was not the slave’s owner, but against whom he held a particular grudge. The case is revealing for what it shows about the difficulties in the formation of personal bonds or relationships by slaves, and the links between the slaves and Khoi workers in the area.[^1]

Fortuijn was captured by slaves on the farm of Pieter Venter, a place to which he had escaped from his owner. He knew the farm well, since he had previously had a relationship there with Christijn van de Caab (we do not know if he had then lived on the same farm with her). Venter sent him back to his owner, but he was allowed to go free by the Khoi who was ordered to accompany him. He later returned, supposedly in search of tobacco, but also to see Christijn. She now rejected him, partly because she had another man, but also because, as she stated, her owners did not ‘understand’ such a relationship, or did not approve of it.[^2] His attempt to set fire to Venter’s house was motivated by this obstacle to their continued relationship, and by Venter and his wife’s previous capture and beating of him.

Fortuijn was burnt alive for what the authorities considered to be a heinous crime which threatened the whole region. Slave emotional relationships were certainly not considered to be any excuse.

[^1]: The documents in this case also include the *eijsch* and testimonies by Fortuijn van Bengalen, and the farmers Pieter Venter and Pieter Loubser (CJ 347, ff. 1-19). Christijn van de Caab’s testimony is included here for the details it gives of the problems in her relationship with Fortuijn. These initial testimonies are recorded in the Stellenbosch district records, 1/STB 3/8.

[^2]: This may, of course, have been a convenient excuse on her part.
