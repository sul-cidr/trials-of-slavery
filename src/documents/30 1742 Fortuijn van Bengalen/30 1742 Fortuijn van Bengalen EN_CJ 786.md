# FORTUIJN VAN BENGALEN

**CJ 786** Sententiën, 1736-1743, ff. 377-83.

Since, from the voluntary and verified confession of Fortuijn van Bengalen, bondsman of the farmer Abraham de Villiers, 28 years old at a guess, currently their honours’ prisoner, given without torture or force of bonds, of irons, or even the least threat of suchlike, and from other documents serving the case, it has appeared evident:

That towards the end of the month of November of the past year, without being able to name the exact date, the prisoner, after at first having deserted from his master for a week and a half, came during the night to the lower farm of the farmer Pieter Venter in order to seek some tobacco from the slaves living there, who then took him prisoner and brought him to their master on the higher farm, who had him tied up by a certain Hottentot, named Adam, who was living at that time with the prisoner’s master, and sent him down to his home farm.

That when the prisoner and the aforementioned Hottentot had arrived close to the Paardeberg, the latter lay down after first freeing the prisoner, and saying: “I shall sleep, if you want to get away, you could do so, if you want to stay, you could do so too”, whereupon the prisoner yet again repaired to his master’s farm, named De Leeuwenvalleij, behind Riebeek Kasteel, where he had previously been assigned.

That the prisoner, while the slave whom his master had left at that place was out in the veld with the sheep, then climbed into the house through an open window and stole from there half a bucket of flour, a tea kettle and a dried leg of mutton, with which he proceeded to the Berg River at the so-called Sanddrift, from where, late in the afternoon, he went to the home farm of the farmer Pieter Venter in order to speak to a woman slave of the same, named Christijn, with whom the prisoner had had a relationship for a while.

That the prisoner, arriving there in the evening, went to sit at a pump which stands behind the house of the aforementioned Venter, where the aforesaid woman slave Christijn (after the prisoner had sat at that place for about an hour, coming to collect a bucket of water) got a fright upon seeing him, and said to him: “I don’t wish to have anything to do with you any more, you must never come here again in your life, I have another man”, proceeding then, without saying anything more, with the bucket of water to the house.

That the prisoner, after the aforementioned Christijn had left, lit a pipe of tobacco and, while smoking it, became dejected because this *meijd* had left him, as well as getting angry, not only because the said Venter had him taken prisoner and tied him up, but also because, some time ago, the same’s wife, upon catching the prisoner in her house, had beaten him with a broomstick and burnt his cap. Which is when he decided to set the residence of the aforementioned Pieter Venter on fire, which the prisoner did in fact do that very night, making to this end a little flue from an old cloth which was lying by the pump, and having set the same on fire with his pipe, he went with it to the said house, where he stuck the burning flue under the roof, which is quite low, into the thatch. After the roof was in flames for up to a width of nearly one and a half fathoms,[^1] the fire was extinguished by the said Pieter Venter and some other people, who, together with his wife and children, were lying asleep in the very room where the prisoner had started the fire, and amongst whom the *heemraad* Pieter Laubser woke up first because of the heavy smoke and fumes that were in the house. The prisoner, as soon as he had done this, removed to his hiding place at the aforesaid Sanddrift, where he, after staying there for about four days, was taken prisoner by the burghers Claas Laubser and Hendrik Venter, and was subsequently delivered into the hands of justice by the aforementioned Pieter Venter and the same’s son, after he had already confessed, upon being questioned by the same on his home farm, to have committed this arson.

And since a heinous atrocity such as the one committed by the prisoner, through which not only the ruin of a farmer, but at times even the downfall of a whole district could be dreaded, cannot remain unpunished in a country where law and justice are observed, but should on the contrary be punished in an exemplary fashion as a warning and deterrent to other similar malefactors.

Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice of this Castle, serving today, having seen and read with attention the written *criminelen eijsch ende conclusie*, drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoner by the landdrost, *Sieur* Pieter Lourensz, by reason of his office, besides having noted the same’s voluntary and verified confession, and everything else which further served the case and could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the free United Netherlands and, having judged the prisoner, Fortuijn van Bengalen, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the place where criminal sentences are usually executed here, there to be handed over to the executioner and, standing upright, to be tied with a chain to a stake and to be burnt alive; the remains of the corpse burnt to death are to be taken to the outside place of execution, there to be placed upon a wheel with an iron pot above the head (denoting the arson), to remain like this until being consumed entirely; with sentencing to the costs and expenditure of justice.[^2]

Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 4 January 1742, as also pronounced and executed on the 6^th^ thereupon.

Let the execution be done, \[signed\] H. Swellengrebel.

\[signed\] R. Tulbagh, P. Reede van Oudshoorn, R.S. Allemann, Ns. Heijning, Cl. Brand, Js. Möller, Corns. Eelders, Js. de Grandpreez, Am. Decker, W. v. Kerkhoven, D. d’Aillij, Dl. Pfeil, G. la Febre, J. Cruijwagen.

Mij praesent, \[signed\] D.G. Carnspek, secretary.

[^1]: About 3 metres.

[^2]: This sentence was recommended in the *eijsch*, CJ 347, f. 8v and recorded in the *regtsrollen*, CJ 24, ff. 1-2. The significance of an iron pot as a symbol of arson is unclear. Fortuijn’s burning alive was observed by Francis d’Abbadie, a visiting French captain, who commented that ‘he was not long in pain, as he was Presently suffocated by the fiersness \[*sic*\] of the flames’, Boucher 1982: 75-6.
