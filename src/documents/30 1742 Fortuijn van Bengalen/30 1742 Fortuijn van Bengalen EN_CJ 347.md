Today, 26 December 1741, there appears before me, Arnold Schephausen, secretary of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, in the presence of the witnesses named below, Christijn van de Caab, bondswoman of the farmer Pieter Venter, about 25 years old, who, on the requisition of the landdrost, *Sieur* Pieter Lourensz, declares it to be true:

That one evening, about a month ago now, without knowing the exact day, the deponent, on her owner’s farm, situated at Riebeeks-Kasteel, named Allesverloren, went outside with a bucket to collect water at the pump which stands close behind the house on the farm of her master. On her arrival there, the deponent saw a certain slave, Fortuijn van Bengalen, belonging to the farmer Abraham de Villiers, and with whom she had previously had a relationship, who called out to her: “Stijn, Stijn, come here”, whereupon she, being very frightened, said: “Oh God, Who is here?”, to which the said Fortuijn answered her: “What are you doing, screaming like that?”, to which she replied: “What are you doing here? You must not come here again, I don’t wish to have a relationship with you any longer, because my *baas* and *juffrouw* do not understand it”, returning then to the house with the bucket of water; without her having seen or spoken to that *jongen* Fortuijn afterwards when he was brought as prisoner to the farm of her owner by the same’s son.

The deponent declares finally that it was on that very night when she had spoken to the aforementioned slave Fortuijn, that her master’s residence was set alight during the night.

There being nothing else to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of her statement as in the text, while offering to subsequently confirm this, her deposition, at any time, if so required.

Thus recorded on the farm of the burgher Pieter van Taak, named Kloovenburg, situated at Riebeek-Kasteel, in the presence of the soldier Jan Philipsz Ploegsteert from Osnaburg[^1] and the sailor Borchart Wenke from Delmenhorst, requested hereto as witnesses of the faith, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the deponent and me, the secretary.

Verification

There appears before us, the undersigned deputised *heemraden*, expressly qualified for this purpose by the honourable Council of Justice, Christijn van de Caab, bondswoman of the farmer Pieter Venter, who declares to fully persist with this, her given deposition, which had been read out word by word, clearly and plainly; therefore having no desire that anything should be added to or taken from it.

Thus verified on the farm of the aforementioned burgher Pieter van Taak on 27 December 1741 before *Monsieurs* Gerhard van der Bijl and Hendrik van der Merwe, qualified for this as delegates by the aforementioned honourable Council, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the deponent and me, the secretary.

Which I declare, \[signed\] A. Schephausen, secretary.
