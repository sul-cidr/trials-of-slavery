# LINDOR VAN MALLEBAAR

**1/STB 3/12** Criminele Verklaringen, 1786-1793, unpaginated.

There appears before the undersigned deputised *heemraden*, the honourables Dirk Wouter Hofman and Jacob Eksteen, Jephta van Batavia, bondsman of the former chief surgeon of the honourable Company’s hospital at the Cape, the honourable Pieter Domus,[^1] who declares, on the requisition of the landdrost here, the honourable Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, it to be true:

That fourteen days before yesterday, the deponent was ordered by his owner, shortly before the same repaired to bed in the afternoon, to have his fellow slaves Lindor van Mallebaar and Galant van Bougies spit a certain piece of land in the garden. That since, after waiting for half an hour, the aforementioned Lindor had not come to the garden, the deponent went to the kitchen and looked through the window to see whether or not the aforementioned Lindor was in there.

That the deponent saw the aforementioned Lindor, having the innocent daughter of his owner, named Mietjie, sitting backwards on his lap. The deponent called out to him: What are you doing with the *nonje* on your lap? Upon which the aforementioned Lindor instantly stood up, and when the deponent went from the window and entered the kitchen through the door, he found the aforementioned Lindor busy doing up his trousers.

That the deponent thereupon immediately went to the bedroom of his owner and found him in the *galderij*, to whom the deponent, out of scruple and also because he did not wish to hurt his owner’s feelings, only reported to have found Lindor with the aforementioned daughter of his owner, and that when he had called out: “What are you doing with *nonje*?”, the same had stood up, but not that the deponent, upon entering the kitchen door, had seen the aforementioned Lindor doing up his trousers. Likewise, for the same reason as above, the deponent similarly did not inform the petitioner of the latter when he enquired about this incident.

There being nothing more to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, declaring it to be the whole truth.

Thus recorded at the secretary’s office in Stellenbosch on 20 July 1793.

This mark X was set down by the deponent with his own hand.

As delegates, \[signed\] D.W. Hoffman, J. Eksteen.

In my presence, \[signed\] J.P. Faure, secretary.
