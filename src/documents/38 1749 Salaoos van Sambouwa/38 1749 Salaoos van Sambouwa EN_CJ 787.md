# SALAOOS VAN SAMBOUWA

**CJ 787** Sententiën, 1744-1749, ff. 360-64.

Since, from the voluntary, verified confessions of Salaoos van Sambouwa, bondsman of the burgher Gijsbert Rogier, age 28, December van Sambouwa, slave of the chief ship’s carpenter Barend van Dockum, age 36, Baatjoe van Macassar, belonging to the burgher Juriaan Jansz, age 25, and the Chinese banished here, Limoeijko, 40 years old at a guess, all currently their honours’ prisoners; and from the other documents produced in the case, it has come to appear evident to the honourable Council of Justice of this Castle of Good Hope:

That on Sunday, which was the 26^th^ of the past month October, the first prisoner made an arrangement with the second and third prisoner to come to the house of the prisoner’s owner on that very night and to assist him there in stealing some flour. That the first prisoner then went on his own to the home of the fourth prisoner and offered to sell him the flour, without being able, though, to agree with the same on a fixed price, seeing that the fourth prisoner first wanted to see how much flour the first prisoner would bring. Because of the bad weather which developed, the first three prisoners could not bring about their thievish intention that Sunday night; however, on the following Tuesday, the second prisoner – after first having warned the third prisoner that same afternoon to come to him on the beach that very evening for the execution of their intention – went after 10 o’clock at night from the back door of his owner’s \[house\] to the beach, where the third prisoner was awaiting him, and then, both of them went to the house of the burgher Gijsbert Rogier and, since the door of the alley was locked, climbed over the wall into the yard by means of a bamboo stick, which the second prisoner had brought along from his owner’s, and then went into the kitchen, whose door was only on the latch; which is when the first prisoner, having been roused by them in accordance with their arrangement, proceeded with the third prisoner to the attic, while the second prisoner remained as sentry down in the kitchen, and with the same he took down from there by small lots, in three to four bags, about one and a half sacks of sieved flour. The first prisoner, after first opening the door of the alley, went with a whole sack and the third prisoner with half a sack of the aforementioned stolen flour, besides the second prisoner with the bamboo stick, on their way to the home of the fourth prisoner. And when the first prisoner arrived, with the *ratelwacht* Willem van Dijk, who had discovered and followed him along the way, at the aforementioned house, the sack of flour was immediately accepted by the fourth prisoner and put down besides the door in the *voorhuijs*. The third prisoner, upon noticing that something was wrong, threw down the sack which he was carrying on his shoulder before the door of the fourth prisoner, and got away by fleeing, while the first and second prisoners were apprehended that very same night by the aforementioned *ratelwacht* Van Dijk with the help of his colleague, Booijens Claassen, who had arrived there in the meantime; and, together with the third and fourth prisoners, were delivered the day thereafter into the hands of justice.

And since the perpetration of such a theft and the receipt of stolen goods cannot be tolerated in a country where justice is properly practised, but should, on the contrary, be punished in an exemplary fashion, as a warning and a deterrent to other such malefactors.

Thus it is that the honourable Council of Justice, serving today, having carefully read and considered the written *crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie*, drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoners by the honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, in his official capacity, as well as having noted both the voluntary confessions of the first three prisoners and the other documents added to it, all properly verified in court, besides having heeded everything that served the case and could possibly have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the United Netherlands, as well as his most serene highness, the Lord Prince of Orange, as its hereditary Stadholder, Captain and Admiral General, having judged all four of the prisoners, Salaoos and December, both van Sambouwa, Baatjoe van Macassar and the Chinese Limoeijko, is sentencing them with this: to be taken to the place where criminal sentences are usually executed here, there to be handed over to the executioner, the first prisoner, Salaoos van Sambouwa, first to be exposed with the rope around his neck under the gallows, then, together with the second, third and fourth prisoners to be bound to a stake, to be severely scourged with rods on their bare backs, branded, and the first three prisoners, Salaoos, December and Baatjoe, thus to be sent home again to their owners, provided they pay the costs, besides the fourth prisoner, Limoeijko, who is yet again to be confined in chains on the honourable Company’s public works for his whole life; with sentencing all four prisoners to the costs and expenditure of justice; and denying the further or otherwise drawn-up *eijsch* of the honourable Officer with regard to all the prisoners.[^1]

Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 13 November 1749, as also pronounced and executed on the 15^th^ thereupon.

Let the sentence be done, \[signed\] H. Swellengrebel.

[^1]: Salaoos was displayed standing under the gallows with a rope around his neck, and was then, with the other three, whipped and branded. The three slaves were sent back to their owners, while Limoeijko was sentenced to labour in chains on the Company’s public works for life, CJ 31, ff. 99-102. This was more lenient than the death sentence for Salaoos, the ten years in chains for December and Baatjoe and the life imprisonment in the Company battery for Limoeijko that were recommended in the *eijsch.* The *eijsch* and the testimonies of the accused and the burgher *ratelwacht* are in CJ 357, ff. 415-33.
