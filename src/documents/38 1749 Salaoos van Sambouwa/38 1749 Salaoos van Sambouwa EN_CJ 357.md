There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, the Chinese Limoeijko, 40 years old at a guess, who, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, confesses it to be true:

That eight days ago now, or the night between last Tuesday and Wednesday, being unable to name the exact hour, the confessant opened his door when somebody knocked on it, since he thought that it was *volk* who came to call him to go fishing with them.[^1] However, he then noticed that it was a black *jongen*, to whom there instantly came yet another *jongen*, carrying a sack of flour, and who wanted to sell it to him, at the same time also coming with the flour just inside the front of his house. The confessant, seeing that he did not wish to buy this, wanted to have these *jongens* gone from there, but while he was talking to these *jongens* to this end, there also arrived in front of his door two men of the *ratelwacht* who then, uncovering what was happening there, took these two *jongens* away from there and took them to the prison, without him, the confessant, knowing anything further about this.

He also declares that he did not present any money to the men of the *ratelwacht* in order to keep quiet about what happened.

Thus confessed at the Cape of Good Hope on 5 November 1749 before the honourables Am. Decker and B. Artoijs, members of the aforementioned honourable Council of Justice, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant and me, the secretary.

Which I declare, \[signed\] Jn. Fr. Tiemmendorf, secretary.

[^1]: Fishing was an important economic activity among the free black community at the Cape and small fishing boats were often collectively owned by several families (Elphick & Shell 1989: 223; Mentzel 1925: 88).
