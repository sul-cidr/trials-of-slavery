# MOSES VAN DE CAAB

**1/STB** **3/11** Criminele Verklaringen, 1759-1782, unpaginated.

Statement given on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Marthinus Adrianus Bergh, by the slave October van de Caab, of competent age, belonging to the burgher Anna Hesselaar, widow of the late burgher Christoffel Groenewald, which is of the following content, namely:

That one afternoon on his owner’s farm when he, the testifier, and his fellow slaves, Slammat, Fortuijn, Salomon, Moses and Januarij, had been busy for some days transporting grapes with the ox-wagon, and to this end were spanning in the wagon, loaded with young grapes, at the vineyard there, the testifier, as also the slave Moses, who each, while doing the inspanning, had a pair of oxen on their hands, both started an altercation with each other, when the testifier said to Moses that he should move the cattle out of the way lest they kick him, and the said Moses answered: “I cannot do that”. He then called out to his fellow slave Januarij, who was standing approximately six steps to the side behind him, with these words (by your leave): “Motherfucker, drive the oxen forward”; then, when the said Januarij (since being rather stupid, and understanding no Dutch but a little Portuguese) did not manage to do this quickly enough, Moses drew a knife with its sheath from the pocket of his trousers and took it with its sheath by the point and then threw that knife with its sheath in such a way at the said Januarij that it flew out of its sheath and hit him, Januarij, in his leg in such a manner that he immediately fell to the ground, bleeding heavily from his leg. Whereupon the said Moses took his kerchief from his head and, after dressing the wounds with it as best they could, they put the aforementioned Januarij on the aforesaid wagon and took him to the house of their owner.

There being nothing more to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing to subsequently confirm the aforesaid, if so required.

Thus related at the office of the secretary at Stellenbosch on 10 March 1775 in the presence of the messenger of the court Morits Herman Otto Woeke and the burgher Johannes Engel, as witnesses.

This mark X was made on his own by the slave October.

As witnesses, \[signed\] M.H.O. Woeke, J. Engel.

With my cognisance, \[signed\] A. Faure, secretary.
