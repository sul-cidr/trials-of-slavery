There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, Claas van de Caab, slave of the honourable Company, 24 years old at a guess, who, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, *Meester* Daniel van den Henghel, confesses it to be true:

That the confessant, having been a runaway for about two months, came to the Cape during the night of last Saturday, the 7^th^ of this current month May, together with a fellow slave of the honourable Company, named Cupido, who had run away long before him. And, after having bought bread and salted herring for a *dubbeltje[^1]*, the aforesaid Cupido, with whom he had decided to go and steal a sheep from the corral of the former burgher councillor, Jan de With, went ahead to that place, while he followed him shortly thereafter and met up with this *jongen*, Cupido, behind the garden of the burgher Jan Heijns. They then went together to the garden and stood in front of the corral of the aforementioned Jan de With, which corral the said Cupido entered by jumping over the wall and, having grabbed and tied up a sheep there, Cupido threw that sheep over the wall to him, after which Cupido, at the opposite side of the corral, jumped over the wall to the outside. While the confessant was picking up that sheep in order to carry it away, he heard a noise and saw some *jongens* appearing, on account of which he yet again lay down that sheep onto the ground, after which he ran away; however, he was immediately thereafter taken prisoner by the slaves of the aforesaid Jan de With.

Thus confessed at the Cape of Good Hope on 16 May 1735.

Today, 13 May 1735, there appears before me, Josephus de Grandpreez, secretary of the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the soldier Jan Plat, of competent age, assigned as *knecht* to the former burgher councillor, *Sieur* Jan de Wit, and who lives in the same’s garden, who, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, *Meester* Daniel van den Henghel, declares it to be the genuine truth:

That at 2 o’clock during the night of last Saturday, which was the 7^th^ of this current month May, the deponent was roused by the shepherd of the aforesaid Jan de Wit \[*sic*\], named Januarij, who came to tell him that a black *jongen* had just jumped over the wall into the corral, took a sheep out of the flock there, and tied the same by its feet, and that he then threw that sheep out of the corral to another black *jongen* standing there. Upon receiving this report, the deponent at once went outside with some slaves, which is when these two black *jongens*, seeing the deponent coming towards them, put the stolen sheep down on the ground and took flight. However, one of them was immediately caught by the slaves of the aforementioned Jan de Wit, which captured slave, the deponent, when he took him to prison the following morning, heard being called “Claas” by the honourable Company’s slaves, and also that the same was one of the bondsmen of the honourable Company.

There being nothing further to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his deposition as in the text, and offers, if so required, to subsequently confirm it with solemn oaths.

Thus recorded at the office of the Secretary of Justice of the Cape of Good Hope, in the presence of the clerks Joachim Nicolaus van Dessin and Frans Augustus Haaks, as witnesses.

That last Saturday, at 2 o’clock in the night, the deponent, lying awake in the corral, saw jumping into it over its wall a black *jongen* who immediately took a sheep from the flock, tied up its legs and then threw it over the wall to another black *jongen* standing by it, after which this black *jongen* also jumped over the wall. Which is when he, the deponent, who up to then had been keeping silent out of fear, went to warn the *knecht* of his *sinjeur*, who thereupon instantly came outside, accompanied by some slaves. And when these two aforementioned black *jongens* saw him coming towards them, they put down the stolen sheep on the ground and took flight. However, one of these was immediately caught by the slaves of his *sinjeur*, and taken to the prison the following morning.

That the confessant, now about three months ago, had run away and then stayed on the mountain above the honourable Company’s *schuur[^2]* in the company of 11 other slaves of the honourable Company and a *meijd*, named Lea van Madagascar, which is where they maintained themselves and obtained food by chopping wood and afterwards going to sell it.

That last Wednesday night at 11 o’clock the confessant, together with a fellow slave of the honourable Company, named Valentijn, who was previously assigned to the stables, came here to the Cape, when the aforesaid Valentijn jumped into the corral of the widow of Servaas de Kok, from which he took two sheep and gave them to him; with which they, each carrying one, went through the Cape[^3] in order to take these two sheep to their hiding place, being met between the house of the burgher Tielman and the houses of the honourable Company by the *ratelwacht[^4]* who took the confessant prisoner; while the slave Valentijn took flight, though leaving the sheep that he was carrying behind.
