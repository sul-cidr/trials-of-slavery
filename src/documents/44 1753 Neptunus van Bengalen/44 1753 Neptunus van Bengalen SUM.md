# NEPTUNUS VAN BENGALEN

*This murder case reveals the conflicts and tensions that could arise between slaves working under difficult circumstances. Neptunus was sent to look after his masterâ€™s cattle post, on the isolated frontier of the colony, without shelter or adequate clothing.[^1] He was accused of negligence, not only by his owner, who beat him, but also by an older slave, Claas van Macassar, who taunted him with his inadequacies as a cattle herder. The humiliated and resentful Neptunus then killed him.*

[^1]: Cattle posts were by this period usually converted to loan farms granted to settlers in the pastoral frontier regions (Duly 1968:15-20; Guelke 1974: 216-21; Mitchell 2001: 125-28; and Schoeman 2004: 285-306).
