This murder case reveals the conflicts and tensions that could arise between slaves working under difficult circumstances. Neptunus was sent to look after his master’s cattle post, on the isolated frontier of the colony, without shelter or adequate clothing.[^1] He was accused of negligence, not only by his owner, who beat him, but also by an older slave, Claas van Macassar, who taunted him with his inadequacies as a cattle herder. The humiliated and resentful Neptunus then killed him.

[^1]: Cattle posts were by this period usually converted to loan farms granted to settlers in the pastoral frontier regions (Duly 1968:15-20; Guelke 1974: 216-21; Mitchell 2001: 125-28; and Schoeman 2004: 285-306).
