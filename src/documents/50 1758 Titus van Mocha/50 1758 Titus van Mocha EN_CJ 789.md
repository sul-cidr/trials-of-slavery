Since from the voluntary, verified confession of Titus van Mocha[^1], bondsman of the farmer Jacobus du Toij \[*sic*\], 27 years old at a guess, currently their honours’ prisoner, and from the other evidence furnished in the case, it has come to appear as clear as daylight to the honourable Council of Justice of this government:

That about nine weeks ago now, because, according to his own assertion, the prisoner was not provided with sufficient food nor clothes, and moreover got beaten every day, he ran away from his aforesaid owner’s farm, situated at Roodesand and, after roaming here and there, resorted to the Cape, and to the foot of Table Mountain, where the prisoner, so he says, hid himself for some time in the garden of the burgher Michiel Breda and sustained himself with the quinces he had brought with him from Roodesand; but finally, forced by hunger, he went at night to the nearby corral of the commissioner of civil and marriage affairs, Arend de Waal, from where the prisoner stole a wether and, moreover, cut off its head, and resorted with it to the Company’s brick furnace with the intention to complete the slaughtering of the aforesaid wether with the help of the slaves of the noble Company assigned to the house beside the furnace; which slaves, however, as soon as he had knocked at the aforementioned house, and it was opened by them, and upon seeing the aforesaid wether, took him prisoner as a deserter, as well as delivering him the following day into the hands of justice.

And since such thievery cannot be, nor should be, tolerated in a well-appointed government, but should, on the contrary, be rigorously punished as an example and deterrent to other similarly inclined scoundrels.

Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice of this government, serving today, having seen and read with attention the written *crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie*, drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoner by the honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, in his official capacity, besides having noted the prisoner’s voluntary, verified confession, and further everything else which served the case and could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the United Netherlands, as well as his most serene highness the Lord Prince of Orange and Nassau, as hereditary Stadholder, Captain and Admiral General of the Republic, sentences the prisoner Titus van Mocha: to be taken to the place where criminal sentences are usually executed here, there to be handed over to the executioner and to be tied to a stake, to be severely scourged with rods on his bare back, and thereupon to be branded, further to be riveted in chains for a period of five consecutive years, to be sent home to his owner, provided he pays the costs and expenditure of justice; with the Council denying the otherwise drawn up *eijsch* of the honourable officer.[^2]

Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 8 June 1758, as well as pronounced and executed on the 10^th^ thereupon.

Let the execution be done, \[signed\] R. Tulbagh.

[^1]: Only a very few slaves at the Cape came from Mocha, a major trading port and coffee-producing centre in Yemen, at the southern point of the Arabian Peninsula. The VOC regularly traded in the area and established a temporary trading post there in the seventeenth century, which they abandoned in 1739 in the face of English competition (Jacobs 2000: 197-202). Titus would only have been a young child when the VOC left the area, but it is not known from where he originated or how he became enslaved.

[^2]: The *eijsch* recommended the death sentence (CJ 370, ff. 168v-69), but the court decided that this was too severe a penalty since Titus had not killed anybody, CJ 40, ff. 48-50. Surprisingly, Titus was charged only with sheep stealing, and not with desertion.
