# TITUS VAN MOCHA

**CJ 370** Criminele Process Stukken, 1758, ff. 172-74v.

Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, by the bondsman of the honourable Company, Coetoe van Madagascar, of competent age, going as follows: That about twelve days ago now, or in the night between a certain Saturday and Sunday, when the testifier, who is stationed with other bondsmen of the honourable Company at the brick ovens and was sleeping with them in a little hut standing there, woke up after twelve o’clock both through the knocking which was done on the door in front and through the barking of the dogs, got up, went outside of this hut and on to the large door and opened it in order to see who could be there.[^1]

That the testifier then became aware of somebody in the dark not far from the hut who was surrounded by the dogs and that, about three paces from him, something was lying on the ground, which the testifier at first supposed to have been another person, but later discovered that it was a sheep; and therefore, after first calling his comrade by the name of Claas to assist him, he called to the person surrounded by the dogs and asked him who he was and what he came to do there. Upon which he, whom the testifier then noticed to be a slave *jongen*, answered the testifier that he came from beyond the kloof, from the burgher Evert Colijn, who had hired him, at the same time requesting that the testifier help him to slaughter the sheep that he had with him.

As the testifier could not believe what this slave was claiming, he therefore tied him up immediately and took him, with the aforesaid sheep, of which the testifier noticed that its head had already been cut off, into the aforementioned hut and left him under the supervision of some of his fellow slaves and forthwith went from there to inform the honourable Company’s potter, who lived not far from there. The abovementioned captive slave then confessed to be a runaway, as also that he had taken the sheep from the corral of the commissioner of civil cases, Arend de Waal, and that he had already cut off its head in that corral. On account of which the testifier, with the help of some of his fellow slaves, took the aforementioned *jongen*, with the dead sheep, to the Cape the following morning and handed them over to their honours’ *geweldiger*.

There being nothing more to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the certainty of his statement as in the text, while offering to subsequently confirm this, his statement, at all times.

Thus related in the office of the Secretary of Justice at the Castle of Good Hope on 11 May 1758, in the presence of the clerks Jochem Hendrik Borgwedel and Carel Frederik Brink as witnesses, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the testifier and me, the secretary.

Which I declare, \[signed\] C.L. Neethling, secretary.

[^1]: According to Mentzel (1921: 65) there were ‘large field-ovens …, containing six orifices, each four feet apart, and forming a long vaulted passage’. These were situated outside the town, at the far end of the Company’s Gardens, which then extended much further than they do today (no. 23 on the map in Mentzel 1921: 86-7).
