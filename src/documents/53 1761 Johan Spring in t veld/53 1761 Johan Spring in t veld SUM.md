# JOHAN CHRISTIAN SPRING IN ’T VELD

*This is a case of violent conflict between a* knecht*, placed in sole charge of the labourers on one of their owner’s isolated frontier farms, and one of the slaves, leading to the latter’s death.[^1] It is intriguing for the unusually clear details it gives of the attitudes of the slave and Khoi workers to their situation: their resentment to working on a Sunday, their challenges to a newly appointed* knecht *who was struggling to assert his authority, and the relationship of the Khoi and slave workers to each other. The cause of the slave Hermanus’s death was not proved, but it appears from this evidence that he committed suicide rather than face punishment.[^2] The case was not sent to the Council of Justice and there is no record that any further action was taken by the authorities.*

[^1]: The presence of *knechten* as overseers of slaves was typical either of farms with a large workforce or, as in this case, on secondary farms or cattle posts where the owner was absent. Disputes between them and slaves were often, as here, over day-to-day working issues. *Knechten* were in a vulnerable position as supervisors but without the ultimate authority of the owner, Ross 1983: 31-2 and Worden 1985: 108-9. Shell (1994: 10-26) argues that *knechten* were in a more temporary and insecure labour position than slaves, although this refers to *knechten* who were supplemenatary labourers, a role that they played especially in the earlier decades of the colony when slaves were in short supply (for examples in this volume, see 1719 Jonas van Manado and 1764 Jan Olivier). For other cases involving *knecht* overseers, see 1726 Scipio van de Cust; 1745 Cupido van Bengal; 1774 Michiel Radijn; and 1779 Ontong van Boegies.

[^2]: It is not clear whether Johan Spring in ’t Veld was taking him to his owner or to the judicial authorities in Stellenbosch for chastisement. Either way, Hermanus realised that he would receive severe punishment for attacking a *knecht*.
