  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>Jan Lategaan ordered his slave Julij van Bengalen to whip his female slave Regina van Ternaten for absenteeism. She later disappeared and her body was found in the veld. This tragic case is an example of the cruelty that slaves could experience from their owners: both the physical violence which led to Regina’s death, and the psychological impact on Julij who was ordered to carry out the whipping but who tried to care for Regina afterwards.</p>
<p>The fiscal recommended that, since some of the evidence was uncertain, Lategaan could only be fined, although he also stated that Julij van Bengalen should be sold and never again be permitted to come under Lategaan or his family’s ownership.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>

                <div class="astro-FK3CUU5Z"><p>Today, 29 November 1749, there appears before me, Jean Benjamin d’Aillij, secretary of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the slave Julij van Bengalen, being of competent age, bondsman of the farmer Jan Lategaan, living on the same’s farm situated in the Wagenmakersvallei, who, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Adriaan van Schoor, declares it to be true:</p>
<p>That a month or two ago now, without knowing the exact day or date, when the deponent was busy working in the garden during the afternoon, he was called by his owner to come to the house and that when he came into the house, he, on the order of his master, had to carry his child on his arm. While doing this, he saw his aforementioned master in the kitchen, tying together the hands of his woman slave, Regina van Ternaten, on her back with a <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-472">riem</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-472"><span class="header">riem</span>A thin strip of leather. It was commonly used at the Cape due to the expense and a shortage of ropes.</span></em>, which is when the deponent, on the order of his <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-473">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-473"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’. In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em>, gave the said woman slave some lashes with the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-474">sjambok</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-474"><span class="header">sjambok</span>This word entered seventeenth-century Dutch via Malay (<em>tjambok</em>) or Javanese (<em>sambok</em>) from Persian (<em>châbuk</em>). It is a whip cut from thick animal skin, usually hippopotamus or rhinoceros, and was already known in the Dutch East Indies as an instrument for punishing slaves. At the Cape it was also used to beat draught animals with.</span></em> on her buttocks. Lategaan then also beat the aforementioned Regina with the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-475">sjambok</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-475"><span class="header">sjambok</span>This word entered seventeenth-century Dutch via Malay (<em>tjambok</em>) or Javanese (<em>sambok</em>) from Persian (<em>châbuk</em>). It is a whip cut from thick animal skin, usually hippopotamus or rhinoceros, and was already known in the Dutch East Indies as an instrument for punishing slaves. At the Cape it was also used to beat draught animals with.</span></em>, both on her back and on her buttocks, while in the meantime the deponent was sent by his owner to work in the garden, whither he indeed went. The farmer Jacob Pienaar then arrived at his owner’s farm, when the deponent was called home again by his owner, and also went thither, and was told by his master that he should lay the abovementioned <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-476">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-476"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em>, who was in the room, by the fire. Yet, when the deponent came into the room, he noticed that the said Regina was cold in the face and not saying a word, and when the deponent warned his aforesaid owner about this, he answered that the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-477">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-477"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em> was just pretending. Some time after this, the deponent again repaired to his work.</p>
<p>That afterwards, when the aforesaid Jacob Pienaar had ridden off, and the deponent had finished his work by evening and had gone to the house, he, on the order of his owner, made a bed for the said woman slave in the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-478">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-478"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch). In most houses this was a room, although in the later design of some Cape houses it referred to a narrower passage (like a hall or vestibule) flanked by one or more front rooms.</span></em>, after which he took her from the room into the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-479">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-479"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch). In most houses this was a room, although in the later design of some Cape houses it referred to a narrower passage (like a hall or vestibule) flanked by one or more front rooms.</span></em>, holding her under the arms, and laid her down on the said bed. That the deponent warmed some food for himself and ate, and then went to sleep in the kitchen, being roused early in the morning by his owner and ordered to light something, which the deponent indeed did, and then saw that the aforesaid woman slave was no longer there, although her bed was still in the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-480">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-480"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch). In most houses this was a room, although in the later design of some Cape houses it referred to a narrower passage (like a hall or vestibule) flanked by one or more front rooms.</span></em>. The deponent’s owner then asked him where the aforementioned Regina was, to which the deponent answered that he did not know.</p>
<p>That some days after this, when the Hottentot woman Catrijn, who looks after the cattle herd of his owner,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> came home in the evening, she told him that, going past a porcupine hole on the mountain above the farm of the deponent’s owner, she became aware of a great stench, and that she was of the opinion that a dead human being must be lying in there. It occurred then to the deponent that it could possibly be the aforementioned woman slave Regina lying there in that hole, and he then told the said Hottentot woman that she should urgently inform the farmer Andries du Toit junior of this.</p>
<p>Finally, the deponent declares that when, on the order of the petitioner, and in the presence of the deputised <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-481">heemraden</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-481"><span class="header">heemraden</span>The origin of this word is uncertain, but is connected to the Dutch words <em>heem</em> (‘homestead’) and <em>raad</em> (‘councillor’).

<p>There being nothing further to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing, if so desired, to subsequently confirm the above.</p>
<p>Thus recorded at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch, in the presence of the burghers Gerrit Kemp and Johan George Zorn, requested hereto as witnesses.</p>

<p>Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Adriaan van Schoor, by the farmer Jan Lategaan, of competent age, being of the following content:</p>
<p>That about two months ago now, without being able to determine the precise day or date, the testifier sent out his slave, named Regina van Ternaten, to the veld to fetch wood and as the said slave did not come back again, he also went out into the veld in order to look for her. The testifier then found her lying asleep and, after waking her up, he made her go to the house, meanwhile giving her some lashes with the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-482">sjambok</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-482"><span class="header">sjambok</span>This word entered seventeenth-century Dutch via Malay (<em>tjambok</em>) or Javanese (<em>sambok</em>) from Persian (<em>châbuk</em>). It is a whip cut from thick animal skin, usually hippopotamus or rhinoceros, and was already known in the Dutch East Indies as an instrument for punishing slaves. At the Cape it was also used to beat draught animals with.</span></em> on her legs.</p>
<p>That when the testifier got home, he ordered his slave <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-483">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-483"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em>, Julij van Bengalen, to beat the said slave on her buttocks with the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-484">sjambok</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-484"><span class="header">sjambok</span>This word entered seventeenth-century Dutch via Malay (<em>tjambok</em>) or Javanese (<em>sambok</em>) from Persian (<em>châbuk</em>).

At the Cape it was also used to beat draught animals with.</span></em>, which was done. The aforementioned woman slave was afterwards ordered by the testifier to sift flour in the room and, while she was busy with this, the farmer Jacob Pinard arrived on the farm of the testifier and departed again a short while thereafter. That at night the aforementioned slave Regina lay herself down in the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-485">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-485"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch).

<p>Finally the testifier declares that when, on the order of the petitioner, and in the presence of the deputised <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-486">heemraden</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-486"><span class="header">heemraden</span>The origin of this word is uncertain, but is connected to the Dutch words <em>heem</em> (‘homestead’) and <em>raad</em> (‘councillor’).

<p>There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing, if it may be required, to subsequently confirm this, his statement, at any time.</p>

<p>When Khoikhoi were employed on farms, they tended to work as stock herders (although they were also used as field workers), but it is unusual to find a woman in this position. Usually Khoi women were used for domestic service or as child minders, especially in the interior (Elphick &#x26; Malherbe 1989: 28-9; Biewenga 1999: 105-8). <a href="#d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>
