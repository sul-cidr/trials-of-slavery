This was the title of a free burgher who served on the <em>Collegie van Heemraden</em> in the rural districts of the Cape, usually for a term of two years.</span></em>, <em>Monsieur</em> Hercules Adriaan Malan, of the following content, namely:</p>
<p>That on Friday the 14<sup>th</sup> of this month, when the testifier’s owner and wife had ridden off, the burgher Gerrit Hartog, who lives on the farm, ordered the testifier to set the table, which she did, and when she served the food, the said Hartog asked her if she had brought the eggs into the house, whereupon the testifier answered that there were no eggs as they had already been collected in the morning. That the said Hartog then continued to repeat this question, and that the testifier continued to persist with her previous answer, that there were no eggs, and that the said Hartog then took up a chair and dealt the testifier four blows with it on her right-hand side. That the testifier then went from the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-743">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-743"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch). In most houses this was a room, although in the later design of some Cape houses it referred to a narrower passage (like a hall or vestibule) flanked by one or more front rooms.</span></em> into the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-744">galderij</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-744"><span class="header">galderij</span>Not a ‘gallery,’ but usually a family room behind the public front rooms of a house where families ate together or where domestic chores were performed. In some earlier Cape houses it referred to a passageway or linking area between the front room and the kitchen area.</span></em>, whereupon the aforementioned Hartog demanded from the cook a piece of smoked biltong, which belonged to the testifier and which he had previously asked the testifier to sell him, for which he was willing to offer her a handkerchief, which the cook gave him and which Hartog angrily threw against the left-hand side of her stomach, next to her navel.</p>
<p>That when the testifier had retreated to the kitchen, the aforementioned Hartog asked her why she was so impudent with him, to which she answered: “I was not impudent”. Hartog then, in the presence of the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-745">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-745"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> Frederik Jansz, who was also in the kitchen, picked up a piece of firewood and dealt the testifier about four blows, both on her back, neck as well as her head, in such a way that this piece of wood came to break, whereupon Hartog took a second piece of wood and again dealt the testifier some blows. This piece of wood then touched the foot of the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-746">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-746"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em>, whereupon he leaped up and pulled the said Hartog from the testifier, after which the testifier went outside.</p>
<p>That in the forenoon of the following day, the testifier, who had been two months pregnant, had a miscarriage as a result of the blows she had received, over which maltreatment the testifier complained to her owner when he came home in the evening.<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of her statement as in the text, being willing, if so required, to subsequently confirm the above.</p>

<p>Dat wanneer, op Vrijdag den 14<sup>e</sup> deeser, des relatantes lijfheer niet &#x3C;t’ huijs was en den burger Gerrit Hartog><sup><a href="#d0-dutch-fn-1" id="d0-dutch-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> en vrouw waren uitgereeden, den op den woonplaats wonende burger Gerrit Hartog de relatante belast had de tafel te dekken, zij relatante sulx ook gedaan en het eeten opgebragt zijnde, en gemelde Hartog de relatante gevraagd had of zij geen eijers in ’t huijs had gebragt, waarop de relatante g’antwoord hebbende dat ’er geen eijers waren, vermits deselve ’s morgens reeds uitgehaad [<em>sic</em>] waren, dan geseijde Hartog dit, zijn gesegde, blijvende repiteeren, en den relatante bij haar vorige gesegte dat er geen eijeren waren, blijvende persisteeren, gemelde Hartog een stoel opgenomen en de relatante daarmede vier slagen in de regter zijde heeft toegebragt. Dat de relatante vervolgens uit het voorhuijs in de galderij gegaan zijnde, meergemelde Hartog van de kock een stuk gerookte biltong, ’twelk de relatante toebehoorde en hij bevorens van de relatante had versogt te kopen, waarvoor hij de relatante een neusdoek zoude vereeren, gevraagd had, ’twelk de kock hem gegeven hebbende, had hij Hartog, in grammen moeden, den relatante daarmede tegens de linkerzijde van de buijk bezijde den navel geworpen.</p>
<p>Dat de relatante alstoen zij na de combuijs geretireerd hebbende, meergedagte Hartog haar toegevoegd had waarom zij zo assurant jegens hem was geweest, en de relatante geantwoord hebbende: Ik ben niet assurant geweest, veelgenoemde Hartog, ter presentie van de in de combuijs mede present zijnde knegt, Frederik Jansz, een stuk brandhoud genomen en haar relatante daarmede een slag á vier zo op de rug, nek als hoofd heeft toegebragt, dermaten dat dat stuk hout is komen te breken, waarop hij Hartog een tweede stuk hout genomen en de relatante opnieuw eenige slagen heeft gegeven. Dan dat stuk houd de knegt tegens de voet geraakt zijnde, was denselven toegesprongen en had geseijde Hartog van de relatante afgerukt, waarna de relatante sig naar buijten heeft begeven.</p>
<p>Dat de relatante des anderen daags voormiddags, door de ontvangenen slagen, als zijnde reeds twee maanden swanger geweest, een miskraam heeft gekregen, over welke mishandeling de relatante des avonds, wanneer haar lijfheer t’ huijs gekomen was, aan denselven klagtig had gevallen.</p>
