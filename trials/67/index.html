  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>This incident of the tracking down, shooting and capturing of a group of Cape Town runaway slaves who had raided a farm in the Piketberg, is primarily of interest for what it reveals about the linguistic complexity of the Cape as late as the 1770s.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> Whereas in the previous case communication problems arose because of the variety of languages spoken amongst the slaves, this one illustrates how slaves were linguistically differentiated from the settlers. The runaways, who were all slaves from the East Indies, spoke Malay to one another, which the farmers and Khoi who apprehended them could not understand, although they attempted to communicate with them in Portuguese.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-2" id="summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The slaves tried to run <em>amok</em>,<sup><a href="#summary-fn-3" id="summary-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> but were shot or captured before they could attack any of their pursuers. Two were killed, while Maart van Bencoule<sup><a href="#summary-fn-4" id="summary-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> and Kuijper van Macassar were captured and questioned.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-5" id="summary-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup> However, the case against them was not forwarded to the Court of Justice and it is not known how they were punished.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-6" id="summary-fnref-6" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup> Also of interest is the farmers’ use of the Khoi Jan as a tracker to locate the barefooted runaways.</p>

<p>It is significant that while the farmer is capable of addressing them in Portuguese, he does not understand Malay. Although no detailed study of this has yet been done, it seems from the available evidence that Portuguese was more commonly used as a lingua franca amongst the slaves and that settlers were more likely to know this language than Malay (see, for example, the data in Franken 1953: 41-79). Although these slaves ignored the farmer’s questions, they undoubtedly knew some Portuguese, as is confirmed by their utterances, which are in both these languages. <a href="#summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>That on Tuesday, the 2<sup>nd</sup> of this month, when the testifier discovered in the morning that the mill on his farm, the Drogerijscloof, situated behind Piketberg, had been broken into during the night, and that two <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-792">mudden</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-792"><span class="header">mudden</span>A measurement for dry goods, usually wheat or flour, the equivalent of about one hectolitre.</span></em> flour had been spilled on the floor and that both bags with some flour had been taken away, the testifier and the burgher Gideon van Zijl Pz., who was outspanning at his place, together with a Hottentot named Jan, searched around on his farm and when they discovered some traces of barefooted people,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> he and the said Van Zijl, each armed with a loaded gun, followed the said traces, together with the said Hottentot Jan and a certain Bastaard named Gerrit, the last mentioned of which only had a <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-793">kirrij</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-793"><span class="header">kirrij</span>This is the Cape Khoi word for the walking stick traditional Khoikhoi carried with them and used as weapons.

When they, about half an hour from the farm of the testifier, saw some clothes lying by the bushes next to the river and, coming closer, discovered four <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-794">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-794"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

Hereupon the testifier repeatedly called to them that they should throw down their knives and should come to him one by one, upon which the said four <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-795">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-795"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

They then, without however getting rid of their knives and cutlass, rushed towards to the testifier, who thereupon told them to stay back, repeating that they should first throw down their knives, whereupon they stood still, while the testifier again repeated what he said before and threatened to shoot at them if they would not throw down their knives. As they still did not do so, the testifier then told the aforementioned Van Zijl that he should just as well shoot one of these slaves in the legs as a result of which they would no doubt give themselves up as prisoners. Which was done by the said Van Zijl but when the shot <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-796">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-796"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Marthinus Adrianus Bergh, by the slave Maart van Bencoule, of competent age, belonging to the <em>fabricq</em>, <em>Monsieur</em> Marthinus van Oorden, being of the following contents, namely:</p>
<p>That some time after the testifier had run away with three of his fellow slaves by the name of Pallas, Julij and Kuijper from their owner in the Cape, having been enticed thereto by the slave Pallas, and taking with them six knives and a cutlass; they went to a certain mountain, which the testifier cannot name, and when they were sleeping there, they were roused by four people, consisting of two Dutchmen<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-5" id="d0-translation-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup> who had guns with them, and two Hottentots armed with <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-799">assegaaijen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-799"><span class="header">assegaaijen</span>This word for a spear or javelin entered European languages via Spanish (<em>azagaya</em>) from Arabic and Berber in the late Middle Ages. Since the foundation of the Cape colony in the mid-seventeenth century, it was used to refer to the spears of the Khoikhoi, and later also for those of other indigenous people in southern Africa.</span></em>. Whereupon they each got up, holding a knife in their hand, but, while the testifier was still rubbing his eyes, he was hit with a shot in his leg so that he immediately fell down, without being able to tell whether the other slaves had defended themselves nor if they had chased the Dutchmen.</p>
<p>There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the certainty of the statement as given in the text, being willing, if so required, to subsequently confirm the above.</p>

<p>Today, 14 June 1775, there appears before me, Abraham Faure, secretary of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the Hottentot Jan, of competent age, who, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Marthinus Adrianus Bergh, declares it to be true:</p>
<p>That the deponent is hired by the burgher Johs. Erasmus Smit and that some time ago, the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-800">veldcorporaal</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-800"><span class="header">veldcorporaal</span>Literally ‘field corporal.’ After 1715, male burghers in the rural districts formed a citizen militia of which the landdrost (magistrate) was the commanding officer. The various divisions (commandos) of a district were each headed by a <em>veldcorporaal</em>.</span></em> Gerrit Smit had asked the said Johs. Er. Smit for the deponent in order to search for the tracks of some deserters who had stolen from him. The deponent then, on the order of his <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-801">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-801"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’. In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em>, did this in the veld and, when he found the tracks, he followed them with the said <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-802">veldcorporaal</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-802"><span class="header">veldcorporaal</span>Literally ‘field corporal.’ After 1715, male burghers in the rural districts formed a citizen militia of which the landdrost (magistrate) was the commanding officer. The various divisions (commandos) of a district were each headed by a <em>veldcorporaal</em>.</span></em> and Gideon van Zijl, as well as the <em>Bastaard</em> Gerrit, until they got in the vicinity of a dry river where four deserters were lying in the bushes, who, when they were called by the the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-803">veldcorporaal</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-803"><span class="header">veldcorporaal</span>Literally ‘field corporal.’ After 1715, male burghers in the rural districts formed a citizen militia of which the landdrost (magistrate) was the commanding officer. The various divisions (commandos) of a district were each headed by a <em>veldcorporaal</em>.</span></em> and told that they should give themselves up as prisoners, came forward with unsheathed knives in their hands, when the deponent (who did not have anything with him but a thin cane) sped to the river in order to find a suitable stick. When the deponent heard a shot going off, turned around and saw that the aforesaid <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-804">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-804"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> were running after Van Zijl, when one of them was thereupon shot dead by the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-805">veldcorporaal</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-805"><span class="header">veldcorporaal</span>Literally ‘field corporal.’ After 1715, male burghers in the rural districts formed a citizen militia of which the landdrost (magistrate) was the commanding officer.

<p>There being nothing further to relate, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the certainty of his statement as given in the text, being willing, if so required, to subsequently confirm the above.</p>
<p>Thus recorded at the secretary’s office in Stellenbosch in the presence of the messenger of the court Morits Herman Otto Woeke and the beadle Johannes Jacobus Reiniers, as witnesses.</p>
<p>This mark X was set down by the Hottentot Jan with his own hand.</p>

<p>This utterance, and the one which follows, not only illustrate how these slaves could communicate in both Malay and Portuguese, but also, as pointed out by den Besten, how often dialectical or substandard forms of an unknown language were misunderstood at the Cape: <em>Amok</em> is Malay for ‘attack’, <em>matta</em> is Creole Portuguese for ‘kill’, but <em>gara</em> poses a problem, as the form which Smit, who knew no Malay, heard and reported to the judicial authorities (who left us the only trace of it) is not known in either language. Den Besten suggests it is the Eastern Malay form of <em>gorok</em> (in which dialect the final consonant gets deleted), meaning ‘to slash somebody’s throat, to butcher’. This utterance can therefore be translated as: “Attack! Attack! Kill! Slash!” (Den Besten 2004: 89-90). <a href="#d0-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>It was common in the eighteenth century to refer to somebody by a shortened version of their job title. <em>Fabriek</em> probably refers in this way to the <em>fabriekmeester,</em> the head of the Company public works. Martinus van Oorden had arrived at the Cape in 1773 and was appointed supervisor for the building of the new Company hospital, in charge of 89 builders (VOC 5222, f. 65 and VOC 6576, f. 197). The slaves appear to have been his personal property, not the Company slaves who worked in the warehouses. <a href="#d0-translation-fnref-4" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>
