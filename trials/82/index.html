Hendrik Roux, of competent age, going as follows: That on the past Tuesday, the 4<sup>th</sup> of this month, when the testifier was going from his garden to the house with a spade over his shoulder, he saw the burgher Petrus Joubert, who is the <em>voorzoon</em><sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> of his neighbour, the burgher Gerrit Victor, following two of his own slave <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-959">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-959"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em>, with a so-called hind oxen <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-960">sjambok</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-960"><span class="header">sjambok</span>This word entered seventeenth-century Dutch via Malay (<em>tjambok</em>) or Javanese (<em>sambok</em>) from Persian (<em>châbuk</em>).

Whereupon the testifier became worried that the said Joubert, as has happened before, might be planning to punish and maltreat the testifier’s cattle herder without any reason; and he therefore rushed home to put away the spade, with the aim to then rush again thither with some of his slaves in order to stop the said Joubert in his intention and to prevent the maltreatment of his slave. And when he had just come out of the house, he noticed very clearly how the aforesaid Joubert had his cattle herder, by the name of Adam, held down to the ground by three of his slaves, while he was busy beating him with the aforesaid <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-961">sjambok</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-961"><span class="header">sjambok</span>This word entered seventeenth-century Dutch via Malay (<em>tjambok</em>) or Javanese (<em>sambok</em>) from Persian (<em>châbuk</em>).

Whereupon his punished cattle herder remained lying on the ground; and when the testifier got to him, he found him to have been pitifully maltreated, as the said Adam was lying for dead and powerlessly on the ground, while blood was running from his mouth and nose, and he was severely scourged on his buttocks, in which circumstances the testifier had the same carried and led home by the aforementioned slaves he brought with him; besides having him transported the following day on a wagon to show this [maltreatment] to the petitioner and to bring in his complaint concerning this against the aforementioned Joubert.</p>
<p>There being nothing more to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing to confirm the same at any time with solemn oaths.</p>

The testifier also declares to still experience much pain both from the wounds on his buttocks and internally in his chest and the side of his back.</p>
