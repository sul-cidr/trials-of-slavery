Ontong played for time by holding a knife to his own throat, but later threatened both his owner and the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-833">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-833"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> with it.</p>

He attempted to use this episode to his own advantage, by changing his original evidence of what happened and by telling the authorities that Ontong was innocent and the fault lay with the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-835">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-835"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> and their owner. Under cross-examination he confessed that he did this to spite his owner, and it was revealed that he had made plans to escape. Adonis was punished by the landdrost, rather than by the Council of Justice, but the case shows how slaves could try to use the legal system of the Company to their own advantage against their owners.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-2" id="summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>CJ 2487</strong> Inkoomende Brieven, 1776-1780, Deel 3, ff. 130-32.</p>
<p>Most honourable Lord!</p>
<p>Concerning the information of the slave Adonis van de Caab, belonging to the burgher Johannes Nieuwout, viz. that in his statement given in the case of his fellow slave, Ontong van Boegies, he deviated from the truth, as I had had the honour to provisionally report to your most honourable in my previous [letter], I now have to report further to your most honourable that the same Adonis, having been heard today in the presence of his owner, stubbornly continues to persist with his aforesaid. Yet, after he had been urged more than once by his owner to say what had brought him to such lies, and if he did not enjoy everything from him that a slave could enjoy from his owner; he kept silent about the first, but could bring to the last nothing other than to address his owner with these words: “Why was <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-842">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-842"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’. In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em> so against me with the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-843">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-843"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em>?” Upon which Nieuwout told the story that the said Adonis had got involved with a so-called <em>Bosjesmans-Hottentot</em> woman residing on his farm, and that he had prevented the same Adonis from doing so because of the vice of this Hottentot woman (whom he intended to let go in order to prevent further corruption amongst his slaves). From which it then appears that because of this, this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-844">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-844"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> became inflamed with vengeance against his owner, and had made use of this underhand trick to accuse his owner of having persuaded him to give a false statement. This can be further deduced from the request made to me by Adonis, viz. to be released from his owner, while adding that he would after all do no good there, and in which request he certainly imagined himself not to be denied, since – apart from some money and a double set of clothes he had supplied himself with – he had also, according to his own admission, left hidden between here and Paarl an <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-845">assegaaij</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-845"><span class="header">assegaaij</span>This word for a spear or javelin entered European languages via Spanish (<em>azagaya</em>) from Arabic and Berber in the late Middle Ages. Since the foundation of the Cape colony in the mid-seventeenth century, it was used to refer to the spears of the Khoikhoi, and later also for those of other indigenous people in southern Africa.</span></em>, a violin, as well as some clothes and trifles. This is abundantly proved when one considers the contradiction in the case, viz. to suppose that Nieuwout was so totally beyond himself that, in order to advance his own damage and the undeniable loss which the absence of the slave Ontong would have caused, he would have polluted himself by giving a false statement, in accordance with the deposition of the aforementioned Adonis, and doing it under oath, through which, as he himself expresses it, he would have brought innocent blood on him and his children.<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> For which reason I then also request your most honourable, taking into consideration all of this, to please allow, in accordance with the supplication of the said Nieuwout and to prevent further damage and manifold expences, the aforementioned Adonis to be punished domestically here at the <em>drostdij</em> and to be returned to his owner. While I have the honour to be, with all respect,</p>

<p>Den slave jongen Adonis van de Caab, toebehoorende den burger Johannes Nieuwout, zig op dit ogenblik bij mij hebbende vervoegt en te kennen gegeven, dat hij omtrent zijn gegeven verklaring in de zaak tegens Ontong van Boegies, meede slaaf van gemelde Nieuwout voor den edelachtbaare Rade van Justitie hangende, niet ter goeder trouwe was te werk gegaan, als hebbende, uit vrees voor zijn lijfheer, de verklaring zodanig verleend, als hem zijn lijfheer opgegeven had; zeggende nader, dat den gevangen op zijn lijfheer niet gescholden heeft, nog hem met ’t mes agteraan is gevolgd, maar dat den gevangen wel ’t mes tegens de keel gezet en zijn lijfheer gedreigd heeft zigzelfs de keel af te snijden; onder betuiging wijders, dat den gevangen door den knegt Engelbregt ten onregten was geslagen geworden met een stok die hij meede bragt en mij vertoonde; achte ik ’t van mijn plicht u weledelachtbare hiervan provisioneel ten spoedigsten kennisse te geven; terwijl ik, om nader ligt in de zaak te bekomen, voornoemde Nieuwout bij mij ontbaden heb, en van ’tgeend bij ’t compareeren van denzelven kome te ontdekken, u weledelachtbare nader verslag zal doen.</p>

<p>Weledelachtbare heer!</p>
<p>Omtrent het te kennen geven van den slaaf Adonis van de Caab, toebehorende den burger Johannes Nieuwout, dat hij zijn verklaring in de zaak van den meede slaaf Ontong van Boegies zoude hebben verleend met afwijking van de waarheid, gelijk bij mijne vorige d’ eer heb gehad u weledelachtbare provisioneel te berigten, moet ik u weledelachtbare thans nader rapporteren, dat denzelven Adonis, heden gehoord zijnde in tegenwoordigheid van zijn lijfheer, halstarrig bij zijn voorseijde gezegde is blijven persisteren. Dog, nadat hij door zijn lijfheer een en andermaal gedrongen was geworden om te zeggen wat reden hem Adonis tot zulk een leugentaal had gebragt, en of hij niet al van hem genoot dat een slaaf van zijn lijfheer te genooten had, konde denzelven, op ’t eerste zwijgende, tegens ’t laaste niets inbrengen; maar voerde hij zijn lijfheer in deeze woorden te gemoed: Maar waarom is baas mij dan zo tegen geweest met de mijd? Op ’twelke Nieuwout verhaalde dat gemelde Adonis zig ingelaten hebbende met eene zogenaamde Bosjesmans Hottentottin, bij hem woonachtig, hij, om de ondeugd van deeze Hottentottin (die hij voornemens was, tot voorkoming van verder bederf onder zijne slaven, te laten gaan) denzelven Adonis daarin had verhinderd. Waaruit dan blijkt dat deezen jongen hierover met een wraaktlust tegen zijn lijfheer bezielt geraakt zijnde, ’t sinister practijcq heeft gebruikt om zijn lijfheer te betigtigen dat denzelven hem tot het verlenen van een valsche verklaring had gepersuadeert. Dit kan nader worden afgenomen uit ’t verzoek, door hem Adonis bij mij gedaan, om van zijn lijfheer ontslagen te mogen worden, met bijvoeging dat hij dog geen goed bij denzelven zoude doen, en in welk verzoek hij zig zekerlijk verbeeld heeft niet te zullen missen, als hebbende, behalven eenig geld en dubbele klederen, waarvan hij hem had voorzien, nog tusschen dit en de Paarl, volgens zijn eigen bekentenis, verborgen gelaten: een assegaij, een viool, nevens eenige klederen en klijnigheden. Het gezegde word ten overvloede geprobeert wanneer men de contradictie in de zaak zelve betragt, om hem Nieuwout namentlijk te supponeren zig zelven zo verre te hebben vergeten, dat hij, ter bevorderinge van zijn eigen schade en ontegensprakelijk verlies als ’t gemis van den slaaf Ontong meede brengt, zig zoude bezoedelen met het verlenen van een valsch relaas, strokende met de depositie van voormelde Adonis en het beëedigen van dien, waardoor dus, gelijk hij zig uitdrukte, onschuldig bloed zoude werden gebragt op hem en zijne kinderen. Om welke redenen dan ook verzoeke dat u weledelachtbare op ’t een en andere reguard nemende, gelieve te permitteren dat, ingevolge ’t supplicq van gedagte Nieuwout, om zijne verdere schade en veelvuldige oncosten te vermijden, meergemelde Adonis alhier ter drostdije domesticq worde afgestraft en aan zijn lijfheer terug geleverd. Terwijl d’eer heb, met alle hoogachting, te zijn,</p>

<p>That during the morning of a certain Thursday, about fourteen days ago now, without wishing to hazard a guess about the precise date, when the deponent was busy, together with his fellow slave Ontong van Boegies and the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-848">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-848"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> of his said owner, by the name of Pieter Engelbregt, cutting grapes in the vineyard, the said Ontong, who was some paces away from them, asked the said Engelbregt whether he, Ontong, too should be cutting, and when Engelbregt answered to this that he should just continue with the carrying and that he, Engelbregt, would finish cutting the row, this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-849">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-849"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

Meanwhile, the said Ontong made some movements with his arm, in which he held a <em>boslemmer</em> knife,<sup><a href="#d1-translation-fn-2" id="d1-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> in the direction of the said Engelbregt, but the said Engelbregt dealt this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-851">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-851"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>That the deponent’s owner, who in the meantime had got there, reprimanded this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-852">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-852"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>That as the deponent’s owner returned to the house again, the said Ontong went after him for some paces with a [carrying] pole<sup><a href="#d1-translation-fn-3" id="d1-translation-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> and a knife in his hand, but immediately returned to the said Engelbrecht and the deponent, when Engelbregt and the deponent, from fear that they might be attacked by this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-853">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-853"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>There being nothing more to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the certainty of his statement as in the text, and declares further, in the presence of the slave Ontong van Boegies, all of the above to be the whole truth.</p>
<p>Thus done and verified in the Castle of Good Hope on 29 March 1779 before the honourables Lodewijk Christoph Warneck and Christiaan George Maasdorp, members of the honourable Council of Justice, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the deponent and me, the sworn clerk.</p>

<p>A <em>boslemmermes</em> is described as a ‘hunting knife’ but at the Cape this knife – which had a short, usually curved, blade – was used especially for the harvesting of grapes.

                <div class="astro-FK3CUU5Z"><p>Since Ontong van Boegies, slave of the farmer Johannes Nieuwout, 50 years old at a guess, currently their honours’ prisoner, has voluntarily confessed and, since from the other documents produced in the case, it has appeared clear as daylight to the honourable Council of Justice:</p>
<p>That on a Thursday morning about the middle of the month March of this year, or at the time of wine pressing, when the prisoner, who works on his owner’s farm, called De Salomons Valleij, situated in the Drakenstein district, was in the vineyard together with the burgher Pieter Engelbregt, who lives as <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-855">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-855"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> with the prisoner’s owner, as also his fellow slave Adonis, and asked if he too should cut grapes, he was answered by the aforesaid Engelbregt, who was then in the same row of vines about twenty paces from him, that he should rather carry the grapes to the cellar, as he, Engelbregt, would himself cut that row. The prisoner immediately cursed Engelbregt for a <em>moervreeter</em> and a child of a whore and asked if Engelbregt had anything else to order as well, at the same time adding: “Come, try and beat me!”</p>
<p>That at this, Engelbregt took up a piece of firewood and went to the prisoner and dealt him, because of his insolence, two or three blows with it. The prisoner’s owner, who had seen and heard from his house that the prisoner was raging against the aforementioned Engelbregt with swear words, therefore went to the vineyard and called from afar to Engelbregt: “Go on, hit him!”, upon which the aforementioned Engelbregt gave the prisoner some more blows and, noticing then that the prisoner made a small movement with his arm, in which hand he was holding a <em>boslemmer</em> knife, he at once gave the prisoner a blow on this arm with the result that the knife fell from the prisoner’s hand onto the ground, and moreover, when the prisoner tried to pick up the same again with his other hand, he gave him a second blow on his back, in such a way that the prisoner fell down to the ground. The prisoner’s owner, who had meanwhile come closer, was reprimanding the prisoner for his insolence and actions but was informed by the aforesaid Engelbregt that the prisoner had a knife in his hands.</p>
<p>That the prisoner then, while uttering a most slanderous curse against his owner, and saying continuously: “So, you want to get it?”, put the knife with its sharp side against his, the prisoner’s, throat; and since the prisoner’s owner had nothing in his hands, he consequently retreated slowly from the prisoner, thinking that the prisoner would kill himself. However, instead of this, the prisoner followed his aforesaid owner for some paces with a pole and a knife in his hands, yet shortly thereupon he stood still, turned around and returned again to the aforesaid Engelbregt and Adonis, who had retreated somewhat out of fear that the prisoner might attack them with the knife he was holding in his hands.</p>
<p>That meanwhile, while his owner was going to his house, the prisoner stood still and, out of anger, while constantly cursing, cut to pieces with his knife the branches of the vineyard surrounding him, while also at the same time repeatedly shouting: “Come here, now!” However, after the prisoner calmed down, he picked up his two baskets of grapes and took them to the cellar where, at his owner’s request, the prisoner’s knife was skilfully pulled from the pocket of his trousers while he was putting down the baskets and thrown away by the burgher Arij Visage, who just then was visiting his owner and had gone from the house to the cellar for this purpose. The prisoner asked the aforesaid Visage why he was throwing away his knife, to which Visage similarly replied with a question, viz. why the prisoner had threatened his owner with it, to which the prisoner, in his anger, said something, which, however, was not understood by Visage. The aforementioned Visage immediately took hold of the prisoner and brought him from the cellar to his owner in the house, where he was tied up and transported to Stellenbosch and thus delivered into the hands of justice.</p>
<p>But since doings like these can under no circumstances be left unpunished in a country where law and justice are upheld, but should, as an example and deterrent to other such scoundrels, be punished according to circumstances.</p>
<p>Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, serving today, having carefully read and considered the written <em>crimineelen eijsh en conclusie</em> drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoner by the landdrost of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, the honourable Olof Godlieb de Wet, in his official capacity, as well as having noted the prisoner’s voluntary confession and moreover everything which further served the case and could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the United Netherlands, having judged the prisoner Ontong van Boegies, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the usual place of justice, there to be handed over to the executioner, to be exposed with the rope around his neck under the gallows, thereafter to be tied to a stake, to be severely scourged with rods on his bare back, thereupon to be branded and then to be put into chains, in which to labour his whole life on the honourable Company’s public works on Robben Island, with sentencing to the costs and expenditures of justice; and denying the otherwise drawn up <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-856">eijsch</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-856"><span class="header">eijsch</span>Literally ‘claim’ or ‘demand.’ This is strictly speaking the <em>eijsch ende conclusie</em> without the final part about sentencing, but the term is often used as a shorthand for the whole document.</span></em> of the officer.<sup><a href="#d2-translation-fn-1" id="d2-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The case was first brought to the Council of Justice on 22 April 1779. Ontong said he did not deserve punishment, and the case was held over for further consideration until 6 May when the sentence above was passed, CJ 61, ff. 22-3. However, Adonis’s change of testimony, received on the same day, probably delayed the execution, which only took place on 15 May. <a href="#d2-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

                <div class="astro-FK3CUU5Z"><p>Nademaal Ontong van Boegies, slaaf van den landbouwer Johannes Nieuwout, oud na gissing vijftig jaaren, thans ’s heeren gevangen, vrijwillig beleeden heeft, en den edelagtbaare Raad van Justitie, uijt de verdere, ten processe gevoegde, stucken, sonneklaar gebleeken is:</p>
<p>Dat wanneer den gevangen, die bescheijden geweest is op zijn lijfheer, in ’t district van Drakensteijn geleegen, in de Salomons Valleij genoemden plaats, zig omtrent het midden van de maand Maart jongstleeden, of in de perstijd, op een Donderdagmorgen, beneevens den, als knegt bij des gevangens lijfheer woonenden, burger Pieter Engelbregt, mitsgaders den meede slaaf Adonis, in den wijngaard had bevonden, en voorseijde Engelbregt, op des gevangens vrage, of hij gevangen ook druijven snijden moest, aan den gevangen, die toen in dieselve reij wijngaardstocken, omtrend twintig treeden van hem af geweest was, tot antwoord gegeeven had, dat hij gev. de druijven maar na den kelder dragen moest, dewijl hij Engelbregt die reij zelfs wel afsnijden zoude. Den gevangen voorseijde Engelbregt opstonds voor een moervreeter en hoerekind gescholden en gevraagt had of hij Engelbrecht ook iets had te commandeeren, teffens daarbij gevoegt hebbende: Komt slaat mij eens!</p>
<p>Dat voorseijde Engelbregt mitsdien een stuk brandhout opgenomen, zig na den gevangen begeeven en denselven, over zijne brutaliteijd, daarmeede twee à drie slagen toegebragt hebbende; des gevangens lijfheer, die vanuijt zijn woonhuijs had ontwaard en gehoord dat den gevangen tegens meergemelde Engelbregt met scheldwoorden te keer ging, overzulks na den wijnberg gegaan was, en voorseijde Engelbregt van verre toegeroepen had: Toe raakt wat!, zulks meergemelde Engelbregt, den gevangen nog eenige slagen had gegeeven; dan ontwaard hebbende dat den gevangen met zijnen arm, in welkers hand denselven een boslemmermes hield, eene klijne beweeging quam te maken, had gemelde Engelbregt den gevangen opstonds een slag op dien arm toegebragt, met dat effect dat daar door het mes uijt des gevangens hand en op de aarde was gevallen, mitsgaders soo als den gevangen poogde hetzelve met de andere hand weeder op te neemen, denselven een tweede slag op den rugge gegeeven had, dermaaten dat den gevangen op de aarde needergevallen was; hebbende des gevangens lijfheer, die ondertusschen nader bij gekomen was, den gevangen over zijne assurantie en bedrijf bekeeven; en voorseijde Engelbregt des gevangens lijfheer voorts verwittigt dat den gevangen een mes in handen had.</p>
<p>Dat den gevangen alsdoen, onder het uijtten van een, teegens zijn lijfheer gerigt, seer vilain scheldwoord, en ’t herhaalde zeggen: Kijk, wilt gij ’t eens zien?, het mes met het scherp, tegens zijn gevangens keel geset hebbende, des gevangens lijfheer, vermits niets in handen hadde, zig dierhalven zagtjes van den gevangen had geretireert, dewijl vermeijnde dat den gevangen hem zelfs te kort doen zoude; dog dat den gevangen, in steede van dien, zijn voorseijde lijfheer, met een draagstok en ’t mes in handen, eenige treeden agteraangevolgt, dog kort daarop stil gestaan had, zig omgekeert en weeder na voorseijde Engelbregt en Adonis gekeert was, zulks dezelve hun iets agterwaards begeeven hadden, uijt vreese dat den gevangen hun, met het in handen houdenden mes, aanvallen mogte.</p>
<p>Dat den gevangen, middelerwijl dat desselfs lijfheer zig na huijs begeeven had, stil gestaan en, onder gestadig schelden, uijt boosheijd de rondsom [<em>sic</em>] hem staande wijngaardstocken, met zijn mes stuckend gesneeden, mitsgaders teffens bij herhaalinge geroepen hebbende: Komt nu hier! Den gevangen egter vervolgens bedaard was, zijne twee manden met druijven opgenoomen en dezelve na den kelder gebragt had; alwaar den gevangen, op versoek van zijn lijfheer, door den, zig juist bij hem bevondenen, burger Arij Visage, dewelke zig ten dien eijnde vanuijt het woonhuijs, na den kelder had begeeven, onder ’t neederzetten der manden, op ’t onverwagtst, het mes behendiglijk uijt zijn broekzak gerukt, en elders heen geworpen zijnde; hij gevangen aan voorseijde Visage gevraagt had waarom denselven zijn gevangens mes weggooijde, op ’twelke meergemelde Visage, den gevangen insgelijx vragenderwijse, toegevoegt hebbende waarom den gevangen zijn lijfheer daarmeede gedreijgt had, den gevangen daarop, in zijne quaadheijd, wel iets had gezegt, ’tgeen door gemelde Visage egter niet verstaan was; des meergemelde Visage, den gevangen opstonds vastgehouden en vanuijt den kelder bij zijn lijfheer in huijs gebragt had, alwaar denselven vastgemaakt, na Stellenbosch gestransporteerd, en dus in handen van justitie overgeleevert geworden was.</p>
<p>Maar nademaal diergelijke gedoente, in een land alwaar regt ende geregtigheijd gehandhaaft word, geensins ongestraft gelaaten werden kan, maar andere zulke fielten, ten voorbeelde en afschrik, na bevinding van zaken gepunieert werden moet.</p>
<p>Soo is ’t, dat den edelachtbaare Raad van Justitie, voormeld, ten dage dienende, met nadruk geleesen en overwogen hebbende, den schriftelijken crimineelen eijsch en conclusie, door den landdrost van Stellenbosch en Drakensteijn, d’ edele Olof Godlieb de Wet, <em>nomine officii</em>, op ende jeegens den gevangen gedaan en genoomen, mitsgaders geleth op des gevangens vrijwillige confessie, zoo wel als op ’tgeene ter zaake verder dienende was en haar edelagtbaarens konde moveeren, regt doende uijt naame ende van wegens de hoogmoogende Heeren Staaten Generaal der Vereenigde Neederlanden, den gevangen Ontong van Boegies hebben gecondemneert, gelijk haar edelagtbaarens denzelven condemneeren mits deezen: omme ter ordinaire justitie plaats gebragt te werden, aldaar den scherpregter overgeleevert, met de strop om de hals onder de galg ten pronk gesteld, voorts aan een paal gebonden, met roeden op de bloote rugge strengelijk gegeeselt, daarop gebrandmerkt en vervolgens in de ketting geklonken zijnde, daarin den tijd zijn ’s leevens op Robben Eijland aan ’s edele Compagnies gemeene werken te arbeijden; met condemnatie in de kosten en misen van justitie; en ontzegging van den anders gedaanen eijsch van den Officier.</p>
<p>Aldus gedaan en gesententieerd in ’t Casteel de Goede Hoop den 6<sup>e</sup> Maij 1779, mitsgaders gepronuntieerd ende geëxecuteerd den 15<sup>e</sup> daaraanvolgende.</p>
