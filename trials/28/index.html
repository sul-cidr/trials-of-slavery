  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>This letter from the Stellenbosch landdrost to the Council of Justice concerned the suicide of a male slave who had attacked a female slave on the same farm because he suspected her of infidelity. It is revealing not only for the emotional bonds between slaves and the use of what today would be described as domestic violence, but also for the ways in which a suicide case was dealt with by the local authorities. They were primarily concerned with the fact that they could not find a tree or beam from which to hang Andries’s corpse. The bodies of slaves who had committed suicide were supposed to be publicly displayed in this way as a warning to others.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Honourable Lord!</p>
<p>Bound by duty, we hereby inform your honour that yesterday, in the late afternoon, the undersigned landdrost was informed that a certain slave, by name of Andries van Bengale, belonging to the lieutenant Johannes Louw Jacobsz, wounded a <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-341">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-341"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em> named Romana van de Caab, bondswoman of the widow of Philip Morkel, who resides with the said Louw on his farm, situated in Drakenstein, known as Kuilenburg, and that he thereafter also wounded himself with a knife. Upon which we, with the secretary, doctor and messenger, set out immediately to that place, where we found, on investigation, that on the 4<sup>th</sup> of this month, late in the afternoon, while his master was not at home and his mistress had gone into the garden, the said <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-342">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-342"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> Andries (who had a relationship with the aforementioned <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-343">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-343"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour.

Why are you doing this to me?” The <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-347">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-347"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em> then grabbed the knife with her right hand, from which she received a big wound on her hand, but holding it nonetheless firmly, and threw it into the kitchen on the floor. In the meantime, the aforementioned slave Andries took a rice pestle, with which he dealt the said Romana, after missing the first time, a sidelong blow on her neck the second time, upon which she fled from the house.</p>
<p>That the slave women who were sitting and doing their sewing with the aforesaid Romana, all took flight when they saw the slave Andries grabbing the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-348">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-348"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour.

The same immediately called some of the slave men, who were working in the garden, to her and gave them orders to catch the slave Andries and to tie him up, lest and before more evil would be done. Yet, coming into the house and looking through a window to the outside, she immediately noticed Andries lying some paces away on the ground of the yard in front of the house, being very bloody and with his entrails hanging from his body. Understanding from her slaves that this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-349">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-349"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>The cut which the slave Andries had given himself goes across his whole abdomen, through the entrails and the stomach, and was therefore fatal; however, the doctor testifies that the wounds of the slave woman Romana are not dangerous.</p>
<p>At our arrival there was still some life left in the aforesaid slave Andries, but, while we were in the house to inform ourselves about this case, and specifically whether it was Romana or this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-351">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-351"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

And since there are no trees around here, and since no timber work can be had from which to hang him by his legs,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-3" id="d0-translation-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> we were obliged, on the request of the said Louw, to have this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-352">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-352"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>This case illustrates the gendered nature of slave labour on the farm: while the male slaves were working outside in the garden, the women were inside the house doing sewing. On the use of slave women for needlework, see Shell 1994: 51-2 and 161. Unlike the plantation slave societies of the Americas, female slaves at the Cape did not usually do regular field work, although there were exceptions, especially during the harvesting season (Worden 1985: 21 and 88). <a href="#d0-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>Aan den edelagtbaaren heere Rijk Tulbagh, oppercoopman en secunde deeses gouvernements, mitsgaders praesident van den edelagtbaaren Raad van Justitie.</p>
<p>Edelagtbaaren heer!</p>
<p>Wij geeven U Edel Agtbaaren bij deesen pligtschuldig te kennen dat aan den ondergetekende landdrost, gisteren teegen den middag, is bericht geworden, dat seekeren slaaf, Andries van Bengalen genaamt, toebehoorende den lieutenant Johannes Louw Jacobsz., op sijn meesters plaats, geleegen aan Draakensteijn, genaamt Kuijlenburg, een meijd, genaamt Romana van de Caab, lijfeijgenen van de weduwe Philip Morkel, die bij gemelten Louw woonagtig is, gequetst en sig selfs daar naar insgelijx met een mes hadde gewond. Waarop wij ons ten eersten met den secretaris, chirurgijn en boode derwaarts hebben begeeven, als wanneer na gedaan ondersoek bevonden hebben:</p>
<p>Dat gemelten jonge Andries (dewelke bij voormelten meijd Romana heeft gehouden) op den 4<sup>e</sup> deeser, den agtermiddags laat, terwijle [<em>sic</em>] zijn meester niet t’ huijs, en desselfs lijfvrouwe naar de thuijn was gegaan, uijt de combuijs in ’t voorhuijs is gekomen en gemelten meijd Romana, die met 2 à 3 andere meijden sat te naaijen, bij ’t hair heeft gevat en vervolgens met een mes, welke in de hand hadde, uijt jalousie, soo wij hebben vernomen, onder ’t seggen: Poeta!<sup><a href="#d0-dutch-fn-1" id="d0-dutch-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> waarom doet ghij soo voor mij?, in de hals heeft gesneeden, vattende die meijd alsdoen, met de regter hand het mes aan, waardoor zij een groote wonde in de hand ontfong, houdende hetselve egter vast, en smeet het vervolgens in de combuijs op de grond needer. Neemende de voormelten slaaf Andries ondertusschen in de combuijs een rijs stamper, waarmeede hij gemelten Romana, naar d’ eerste maal mis geslaagen hadde, de tweede maal een schuijnse slag op de nek heeft gegeeven, als wanneer zij de vlucht uijt het huijs heeft genomen.</p>
<p>Dat de slavinnen, welke bij voorseijde Romana saten te naaijen, soo dra saagen dat den slaaf Andries de meijd Romana bij ’t hair vatte en in de hals sneed, de vlucht hebben genoomen, begeevende hun naar de thuijn bij haarlieder lijfvrouwe, aan dewelke zijlieden dit bekend gemaakt hebbende, heeft deselve aanstonds eenige slaaven, die in de thuijn werkten, bij haar geroepen, geevende aan deselve last om den slaaf Andries te vangen en vast te binden, voor en aleer meerder quaad soude komen te verrigten, dog zij in huijs komende, en door een venster naar buijten siende, heeft gemelten Andries aanstonds ontwaart, leggende eenige treeden voor het huijs op de werf op de grond, weesende seer bebloed, hangende desselfs ingewand uijt het lichaam, en verstaan hebbende van haare slaven dat die jongen doot was, heeft zij aanstonds ijmand uijtgesonden om haar man, dewelke uijtgereeden was, te roepen, die t’ huijs komende en, siende dat er nog eenig leeven in dien jongen ware, heeft daarvan aan den ondergetekende landdrost bericht laaten doen.</p>
<p>De sneede, die den slaaf Andries sig selven gegeeven heeft, gaat over de heele buijk, door het ingewand en de maag, en alsoo dodelijk; dog de quetsuuren van de slavin Romana, betuijgd de chirurgijn niet gevaarlijk te sijn.</p>
<p>In voorseijde slaaf Andries was bij onse aankomst nog een weijnig leeven, dog, terwijle wij in huijs waren om ons te informeren aangaande deese zaak, en bijsonder of de meijd Romana, dan wel dien jongen selfs, desselfs buijk hadde open gesneeden, is denselven komen te sterven, en aangesien hier geen boomen omtrent sijn, en ook geen houtwerk konden bekomen om denselven bij de beenen daaraan te hangen, sijn wij genoodsaakt geweest, op het versoek van gemelten Louw, om dien jongen bij de beenen van de werf in het veld te laaten sleepen; verhoope dat deese, onse gedoente, door U Edel Agtbaaren gunstiglijk sal werden geapprobeert.</p>
<p>Waarmeede wij U Edel Agtbaarens dierbaare persoon en geëerde familie in de hoede des almagtigen Gods beveelen, en betuijgen voorts met d’uijterste eerbiedigheijd altoos te sullen sijn.</p>
<p>Edelagtbaaren Heer!</p>
<p>U Edel Agtbaarens onderdaanige en gehoorsaame dienaren,</p>

<p>Although this is the only instance of the word <em>puta</em> (‘whore’) that Franken could find in his study of Portuguese at the Cape during the VOC period (Franken 1953: 41-79, especially 56-7), it is likely that it was well known amongst slaves, especially as the use of Creole Portuguese as contact language was by this stage well entrenched at the Cape. On Portuguese and Malay at the Cape, see the discussion below in 1763 Christina Strang and 1775 Moses van de Caab. <a href="#d0-dutch-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>
