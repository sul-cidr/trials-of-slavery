  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>Jonas made an appeal to his recently widowed owner to be set free. Manumission of slaves at the Cape was rare, but did sometimes take place by the wishes of an owner at the time of his or her death.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> Jonas presented his mistress with a letter requesting his freedom, which is reproduced here.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-2" id="summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> He clearly believed that some form of written documentation would aid his request for manumission and probably requested his Sunday afternoon off<sup><a href="#summary-fn-3" id="summary-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> in order to have it prepared for him by a letter-writer.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-4" id="summary-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> However, his mistress refused him, a refusal which ultimately led to Jonas’s attempt to stab her in her bed several months later.</p>
<p>The case is also intriguing for the details of domestic life in an artisan household in the Cape.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-5" id="summary-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup> The presence of the many <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-60">knechten</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-60"><span class="header">knechten</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> doubtless led Jonas to make the intriguing assertion that he would be a faithful <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-61">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-61"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> to his owner if freed. Clearly he aspired to the status of the hired labourers in his owner’s home.

<p>That on 20 August of this year, which was a Sunday, there came to the deponent in her bedroom her slave named Jonas van Balij,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> who requested her, seeing that it was a Sunday (and since this was always permitted him by his late <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-63">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-63"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’. In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em>), to be allowed to go out as per usual.</p>
<p>Which was allowed him by the deponent, it being then about three o’clock in the afternoon. That on the Monday, or the 21<sup>st</sup> of the said month, three hours after noon, when she was in the attic of her residence, this slave Jonas came to her, handed over a certain document, and said: “There, <em>Juffrouw</em>”, without saying anything further.</p>
<p>That the deponent read the aforesaid document and understood the contents of it, from which she realised that this Jonas was requesting his freedom from her. Whereupon she asked him if his late <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-64">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-64"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’. In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em> had promised him this, who to this answered her in the negative, but [said] that the late Basilius had always told him: “I will do good to you”; to which the deponent replied that she would not give Jonas his freedom, since his <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-65">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-65"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’. In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em> had not promised it to him, to which this Jonas then answered: “Then I will not do good any longer”.</p>
<p>That after this, when they separated, this slave went the bark house.<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-2" id="d0-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> The deponent instantly followed him there, and after she searched his heart over his suggestion and utterances, while advising him to perform his duty as it ought to be done, this Jonas replied to this that he would not serve her as a slave, but as a faithful <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-66">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-66"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em>, in which he had acquitted himself properly until the 13<sup>th</sup> of this current month.</p>
<p>That at eight or nine o’clock in the evening of the aforesaid 13<sup>th</sup>, which was a Friday, when the deponent was sitting and eating at the table with her <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-67">knechten</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-67"><span class="header">knechten</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em>, who are named Jan van Ees, Willem Mijn and Jan Smuts, she asked this Jonas, since the same did not want to eat, what was wrong with him, who answered to it: “Nothing at all”.</p>
<p>That after she had had her meal, the deponent, having no other thought than that the same slave Jonas had already, as was customary, gone to the attic to sleep, also betook herself, along with her four children, to bed.</p>
<p>That during the night, at about one o’clock, while a candle was burning in the room, one of her children, by the name of Catrijn, who was lying with two of her other children with her in bed, roused her and said: “Mother, Jonas is there”, whereupon she stuck her head through the curtains [of the bed], saw this Jonas, and asked the same: “Jonas, what are you doing here?”, at the same time rising up from the bed, when Jonas said to her: “Shh, <em>Juffrouw</em>”, whereupon he pulled an unsheathed knife from his pocket and stabbed against her chest, but since this did not have any effect, he tried to wound her with the knife on her neck or throat: upon which she grabbed the slave Jonas with the knife in his hand through which her hand became entangled with his in such a way, that he gave the deponent a wound with this knife on her right hand and also, during the struggle, a wound on her left hand.</p>
<p>That, on as many as two different occasions, the deponent tried to draw back the bolt of her bedroom door (with which it usually gets locked and also was, as per usual, locked at this time) but that this Jonas, during the struggle, shut it again every time until she finally managed to open the door while struggling and got to the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-68">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-68"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch). In most houses this was a room, although in the later design of some Cape houses it referred to a narrower passage (like a hall or vestibule) flanked by one or more front rooms.</span></em> with him where they fell over a planing bench, which was standing there; whereupon she roused her <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-69">knechten</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-69"><span class="header">knechten</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> with the calls: “Murder, murder” and: “<em>Knechten</em>, come and help me”, during which this slave pulled open the door, jumped over the lower [half of the] door and escaped in this way, without anybody yet having got to her at that moment.</p>
<p>That on Saturday evening, the fourteenth of this month, the deponent was warned by one of her slaves, named Claas, that the aforementioned Jonas was on the farm and that he had a knife in his hand, upon which she ordered her <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-70">knechten</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-70"><span class="header">knechten</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> to go and have a look, but when they arrived at the farm to look for him, they saw that he had jumped over the wall, whereupon the deponent had the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-71">geweldiger</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-71"><span class="header">geweldiger</span>An old Dutch term for ‘provost.’ At the Cape this was the title of the person at the head of the <em>caffers</em>, the people who in effect acted as the local ‘police force.’</span></em> and the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-72">caffers</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-72"><span class="header">caffers</span>Term for the slaves and <em>bandieten</em> used as assistants of the executioner and who also acted as the ‘police force’ of the town under the leadership of the <em>geweldiger</em>.

<p>All of the aforesaid the deponent declares to be the whole and full truth, asserting to be convinced of the accuracy of her statement as in the text, while offering to subsequently confirm her deposition with solemn oaths, if so required.</p>

<p>This is a very literal translation. Scholtz (1963: 64-7 and 74-7) has shown that the eighteenth-century <em>UE.</em> (the abbreviation of ‘u Edele’, your honourable) developed into the formal Afrikaans second person pronoun <em>u</em>, and therefore the usage here might simply be an attempt to say: ‘you, <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-86">juffrouw</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-86"><span class="header">juffrouw</span>Strictly speaking this contraction of <em>jonkvrouw</em> was the form of address for a noble lady (as with <em>jonker</em>, the contraction of <em>jonkheer</em>, ‘lord’), but at the Cape it was more generally used by settlers for women with some social status.

<p>The original has the male form of the pronoun, but it clearly has to refer to Jonas’s mistress. It is likely that this may reflect a feature of the sort of Dutch many slaves spoke, as the use of male pronouns for all genders is quite common in certain second-language varieties. For another example, see the sentence uttered by Claas in 1744 Claas van Bengalen and Augustus van Mallebaar. <a href="#d0-translation-fnref-5" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>Dat, op den 20<sup>e</sup> Augustus jongstleeden, zijnde Sondag, bij haar comparante in haar slaapcamer gekomen is, haare slaaf genaamt Jonas van Balij, dewelke aan haar heeft versogt, terwijl het Sondag was (en overmits hem sulx door zijn overleedene baas telkens gepermitteert was geworden), na ouder gewoonte te mogen uijtgaan. ’Twelke door de comparante hem wierd toegestaan, zijnde het alsdoe omtrent drie uuren naar de middag.</p>
<p>Dat zij comparante, des Maandags, naarmiddags te drie uuren, daaraan, ofte den 21<sup>e</sup> van gemelde maand, op de solder van haar wooning zijnde, deese slaaf Jonas bij haar is gekomen, haar seeker papier overhandigt en gezegt: Daar Juffrouw, sonder iets meer te spreeken.</p>
<p>Dat zij comparante het voorseijde papier geleesen en den inhoud van dien verstaan hebbende, daaruijt heeft ontwaart dat deese Jonas zijn vrijdom aan haar versogt. Waarop zij aan denselven heeft afgevraagt of zijn overleedene baas hem sulx belooft hadden, die daarop ten antwoord gaf van neen, maar dat den overleedene Basilius hem altijt hadde gezegt: Ik zal jouw goet doen, daar zij comparante op gerepliceert heeft, hem Jonas niet vrij te sullen geeven, terwijl hem zijn baas ’tselve niet belooft had, daar door deese Jonas wederom op geantwoord wierd: Dan sal ik geen goet meer doen.</p>
<p>Dat zij daarop van den anderen zijn geschijden, deese slaaf naar ’t basthuijs gegaan [<em>sic</em>], zij comparante hem subiterlijk derwaarts is gevolgt, en hem eens over zijne voorstelling en geuijten woorden in ’t gemoed tastende, met recommandatie zijn pligt naar behooren te betragten, deese Jonas daarop ten antwoord heeft gegeven dat hij haar niet dienen soude als een slaaf, maar als een getrouwe knegt, in ’t welke hij tot den 13<sup>e</sup> deesen loopende maand sig naar behooren heeft gequeeten.</p>
<p>Dat zij comparante op den 13<sup>e</sup> voorseijde, zijnde Vrijdag, des avonds de clokke agt of neegen uuren, aan de tafel met haar knegts sittende te eeten, zijnde genaamt Jan van Ees, Willem Mijn en Jan Smuts, aan deese Jonas, overmits deselve niet wilde eeten, heeft gevraagt, wat hem scheelde, die daarop ten antwoord gaf: Niemendal.</p>
<p>Dat zij comparante, naar gespijsigt te hebben, en van geen andere gedagten weesende of denselven slaaf Jonas was naar oude gewoonte bereets op ’t solder gaan leggen slaapen, haar neevens derselver vier kinderen ook te rust heeft begeeven.</p>
<p>Dat omtrent des nagts ten een uuren, terwijl een kaars in haar camer brande, eene van haar kinderen, Catrijn genaamt, die beneevens nog twee andere bij haar comparante te bedde lagen, haar heeft wakker gemaakt en teegen de comparante gezegt: Moeder, daar is Jonas, waarop haar hoofd buijten de gordijnen steekende, deese Jonas heeft ontwaard en aan dezelve gevraagt: Jonas, wat doe je hier?, tegelijk uijt het bedde oprijsende, hij Jonas teegen haar heeft gezegt : Soet, Juffrouw, vervolgens daarop een bloot mes uijt zijn sak trekkende, haar daarmede op de borst heeft gestooten, ’twelke van geen effect zijnde, hij met het mes haar aan de keel of hals heeft getragt te qusten [<em>sic</em>], op ’twelke zij comparante den slaaf Jonas met het mes in de hand heeft aangegreepen, waardoor haar hand aan de zijne sodanig bestuwen is geraakt, dat hij de comparante met dat mes een quetzuur in de regterhand heeft toegebragt, ook in de worsteling een quetzuur aan haar linkerhant.</p>
<p>Dat zij comparante de grendel van haar camerdeur, waarmede deselve ordinair geslooten wierd, en nu ook naar gewoonte bezorgt was, tot twee differente reijsen heeft los gemaakt, en deese Jonas dezelve telkens onder ’t worstelen weder heeft toegedaan, totdat zij eindelijk de deur al worstelende heeft opengekreegen, en in ’t voorhuijs met denselven gekomen zijnde, over een schaafbank, aldaar staande, is gevallen, en voorts haar knegts, met het roepen van: Moord, moord, en: Knegts, komt mij te hulp, heeft wakker gemaakt; onder ’twelke deese slaaf de voordeur heeft opgerukt [<em>sic</em>], en onder de onderdeur gesprongen, mitsgaders alsoo g’eschapeert is, sonder datter alsdoe nog iemand bij haar was.</p>
<p>Dat zij comparante des Saturdag avonds, zijnde den 14<sup>e</sup> deeser, door een van haar slaven, Claas genaamt, gewaarschouwt is geworden dat meergemelde Jonas op de plaats was en een mes in de hand hadde, waarop zij haar knegts heeft geordonneert om daarna uijt te sien, dog wanneer deselve op de plaats quamen om naar hem te soeken, zij gesien hebben dat hij over de muur is gesprongen, waarop zij comparante de geweldiger en caffers heeft laaten roepen om deesen Jonas in apprehentie sien te krijgen dewelke, gekomen zijnde, dienselven avond, omtrent de clokke half neegenen, deese slaaf Jonas, in de erweten agter haar huijs, in ’t thuijntie staande, sig verborgen hebbende, aldaar door de geweldiger, in presentie van haar knegts, caffers en slaven, is geattrappeert, en vervolgens alsoo in handen van justitie geraakt.</p>

                <div class="astro-FK3CUU5Z"><p>As Jonas van Manado, 30 years old at a guess, bondsman of Hermina Herwigh, widow of Jan Basilius Creitsmar,<sup><a href="#d1-translation-fn-1" id="d1-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> currently their honours’ prisoner, has voluntarily confessed and admitted, without any torture or coercion of bonds, of irons, or any threat of suchlike; and since it has appeared most evident to the honourable Council of Justice:</p>
<p>That, in order to bring about his freedom, the prisoner, shortly after the passing away of his patron, the aforementioned Jan Basilius Kreitsmar, presented a petition to his said mistress in the attic of her home at 3 o’clock on the afternoon of August the 21<sup>st</sup> of this year, by means of which he requested his freedom from her. That his mistress, having read this document, asked the prisoner if his <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-87">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-87"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’. In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em> had promised him such; to which the prisoner answered: “No”, but that his late master had always said to him: “I will do good to you”.</p>
<p>Upon which his aforementioned mistress replied that as long as she lived, she would not sell him, nor emancipate him. That the prisoner hereupon did not scruple to address her thus: “Then I will not do good any longer”, for which impudent words he was reprimanded by his mistress. On this occasion he also told her that he would not serve her as a slave, but as a faithful <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-88">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-88"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em>.</p>
<p>That the prisoner, on the 13<sup>th</sup> of the past month October, between 8 and 9 o’clock in the evening, was asked by his mistress, while she was sitting at the table eating with her <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-89">knechten</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-89"><span class="header">knechten</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em>, if something was wrong with him that he would not eat, to which he answered (so he asserts) that he was a bit drunk. Whereupon the prisoner, after his mistress had eaten, instead of going to his usual sleeping place, dared to be so audacious as to hide himself in her bedroom under the bed, with the intention to steal.</p>
<p>That the prisoner kept himself hidden under that bed until midnight, which is when he got up from there and went to a table, upon which was a bottle of wine, and drank from this bottle. That while the prisoner was busy doing this, the little daughter of his mistress, by the name of Catrijn, woke up and, when she noticed the prisoner, roused her mother who, upon seeing the prisoner, asked him: “Jonas, what are you doing here?”, while at the same time rising from her bed. The prisoner went to her and said: “Hush, hush, <em>Juffrouw</em>, you must not call out”, whereupon, pulling out a knife from his pocket (to instil fear into her, as he asserts), he stabbed his mistress with it in the chest. Yet, since the stab was unsuccessful, his mistress grabbed him by the hand to prevent the prisoner from further evil, thereby wounding both her hands.</p>
<p>That while the prisoner was wrestling with his mistress, she drew back the bolt of the door and tried to escape, but the prisoner pushed the door shut again every time, until at last his mistress, after a lengthy struggle, got the door open, and came falling over the planing bench into the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-90">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-90"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch). In most houses this was a room, although in the later design of some Cape houses it referred to a narrower passage (like a hall or vestibule) flanked by one or more front rooms.</span></em> with the prisoner, at which she called out: “Murder, murder” and “<em>Knechten</em>, come and help me!”, while the prisoner pulled the front door open and fled, with the knife in his hand (which was shown to him in court), from the house towards Table Mountain.</p>
<p>However, that the prisoner, after having committed this gross crime, did not fear nor scruple to return to the farm of his mistress the following evening – this time (as he asserts) having the knife in his pocket – in order to sleep there, with the intention to once again flee to the mountain the following morning, and thus he fell into the hands of justice.</p>
<p>All of which is public and murderous violence, committed during night-time by an armed slave against his defenceless mistress in her locked bedroom, and therefore matters of very serious and pernicious consequences and in all countries punishable to the utmost; accordingly, in a country where justice is administered properly, it may not be tolerated, but should be restrained and punished most severely, as an example and deterrent to all such inclined villains.</p>
<p>Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice of this government, serving today, having seen and read the written <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-91">crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-91"><span class="header">crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie</span>Literally ‘criminal demand and conclusion.’ The document drawn up by the prosecutor based on the evidence he collected and delivered in court against an accused. The <em>conclusie</em> is the final part of the document in which the prosecutor suggested an appropriate punishment for the crime.</span></em>, deliberated by the honourable independent fiscal, Cornelis van Beaumont, in his official capacity, against the prisoner, with the further papers and documents serving as evidence of his audacity; and moreover, having pondered everything which in any way served the case and which could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the free United Netherlands, and having judged the prisoner, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the place where criminal justice is usually executed here, and there to be handed over to the executioner, first that his right hand be chopped off and then, with the same [severed hand] and a knife above his head,<sup><a href="#d1-translation-fn-2" id="d1-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> to be punished with the rope on the gallows so that death will follow; afterwards that the dead body be taken from there, dragged through their honours’ streets and roads to the outer place of execution, there to be hanged again with the severed hand and the knife above the head, and to remain like that until being consumed by the air and birds of heaven; with the costs and expenditure of justice.<sup><a href="#d1-translation-fn-3" id="d1-translation-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Waarop de voormelde zijn meestresse gerepliceert heeft, zoo lange zij leefde, hem niet zoude verkoopen, en ook niet vrij geeven. Dat hij gevangen zig daarop niet ontsien heeft gehad deselve te gemoed te voeren: Dan zal ik ook geen goed meer doen, over welke assurante woorden hij gevangen door voorseijde zijne meestresse bestraft is geworden, op ’t welke hij gevangen teegen haar nog heeft gezegt, haar niet als een slaaff, maar als een getrouw knegt te sullen dienen.</p>

<p>Dat hij gevangen met zijn meesteres worstelende, deselve de grendel van de deur heeft los gemaakt, en getragt te ontkomen, dog dat den gevangen telkens die weeder heeft toegeschooven totdat, eijndelijk, zijn meesteresse, naar lang worstelens, de deur heeft opengekreegen en met den gevangen over een schaafbank in ’t voorhuijs is komen te vallen, als wanneer zij: Moord, moord, en: Knegts, komt mij te hulp, heeft geroepen; onder ’twelke den gevangen de voordeur heeft open gerukt en met het mes in de hand (hem in judicio vertoond) de vlugt uijt het huijs en naar de Tafelberg genomen heeft.</p>
