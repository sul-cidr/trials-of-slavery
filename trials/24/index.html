  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>In this tragic case, Cupido van Mallabaar threatened to take his own life, as well as that of his owner’s wife and her child.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> The episode reveals an intense emotional crisis. Cupido’s complaints that he was made to wear clothing that he was not used to, and that his owners had bought neither other slaves to assist him, nor a female slave to be his companion, reveal the frustrations and alienation of a slave on a Drakenstein farm whose owners merely laughed at his grievances. His ambivalent feelings towards his owners are shown by his vacillation between pity for his mistress and her child and his threats to them.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-2" id="summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The case shows how hard it must have been for an imported slave to adapt culturally to alien circumstances and gives a glimpse into the ways in which he felt and responded to what he experienced at the Cape.</p>

<p>The circumstances are somewhat similar to <em>amok</em> cases (see 1744 Barkat van Timor for notes on this), although, unlike <em>amok</em> perpetrators, Cupido hesitated over his actions because of his conflicting emotions towards his owners. <a href="#summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>That on a certain day during the recently passed month of March, without being able to name the precise date, the prisoner, after he had already gone in and out of his master’s house, situated in Draakensteijn, three or four times, finally entered the house again and went to a room, from which he took a musket and also a box with gunpowder. When the prisoner’s mistress, who was alone at home with her child, saw this, she asked him why he took the musket and what he wanted to shoot with it, and when the prisoner replied to this: “I do not want to shoot you, but myself”, his mistress said: “In God’s name, put it down”, while the prisoner replied: “You just pick up your child”. That the prisoner’s mistress then picked up her child and went with it to the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-232">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-232"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch). In most houses this was a room, although in the later design of some Cape houses it referred to a narrower passage (like a hall or vestibule) flanked by one or more front rooms.</span></em>. The prisoner put down the musket, followed them and, when he got to the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-233">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-233"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch).

And, after the prisoner took off his jacket and shirt and threw them down on the ground, he said, pointing to his leather trousers: “I am not used to wearing trousers like these, I have already worked two or three years here, and I do not see the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-234">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-234"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’.

At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> or <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-236">nonje</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-236"><span class="header">nonje</span>This word entered Dutch from Malay <em>nyonya</em> (which in turn derived from Portuguese <em>dona</em>, ‘lady’) and was in use at the Cape since its foundation. It was used both by settlers to refer to women in general, and by slaves and Khoikhoi as a form of address for female Europeans. It survived in modern Afrikaans in the form of <em>nooi</em> or <em>nôi</em>, ‘young (unmarried) woman’, although it is now somewhat archaic.</span></em> buying a <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-237">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-237"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em> for me,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-238">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-238"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’.

The prisoner at this time also told his said mistress that he once went into the room while her husband was lying asleep with the intention to kill him but, looking at him, the prisoner repented because he took pity on his mistress and her child. After this, the prisoner’s mistress went outside through the door, with the prisoner following her, and who then showed her five bullets which he took from his pocket, saying: “These bullets I have made for myself”.</p>
<p>That after this, when the prisoner again went to the room to collect the musket, his mistress meanwhile sought to take flight with her child, but that the prisoner noticed this and immediately followed her, with an unsheathed knife in his hand, and ordered her to return to the house, saying that he knew full well what her intention was. Whereupon the prisoner’s mistress then went to the house, where the prisoner ordered her to go into the kitchen, and when she had done this, the prisoner stabbed at her at least twice with his unsheathed knife, which stabs the prisoner’s mistress tried to prevent, the first time with her right and the second time with her left hand, as a result of which she got injured on both her hands. After this, the prisoner put the knife in his pocket, took his mistress by her hair and dragged her to the room, saying: “Stay there with your child and look after it”, upon which the prisoner again went from the room into the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-240">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-240"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch). In most houses this was a room, although in the later design of some Cape houses it referred to a narrower passage (like a hall or vestibule) flanked by one or more front rooms.</span></em> where he picked up the musket which was then standing there. When his said mistress noticed this, she came into the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-241">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-241"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch).

The prisoner then put the butt-end of the musket against the wall and its muzzle against his chest, but, without firing it, he put it down again, saying: “You are after all wounded, it would be better if I simply kill you, as you will only go and tell the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-242">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-242"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’. In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em>”; to which the prisoner’s mistress replied that she would not tell this, but rather that she had cut herself on her hands when she tried to slice bread, to which the prisoner answered: “You will do that”. The prisoner’s mistress finally talked him round to go to the surgeon Schabort to fetch a plaster and some brandy for her wounds which were bleeding strongly. To this end, she gave him an empty bottle to take with him, with which bottle he went to a dry rivulet not far from the house, and when he returned from there, the prisoner brought with him half a bottle of brandy, of which he poured some onto the wounds of his mistress. According to what the prisoner says, he had obtained this brandy from a certain <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-243">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-243"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em>, named Januarij, belonging to the burgher David Villier.</p>
<p>That after he had done this, the prisoner also said to his mistress: “It would be better if I murder you, your husband and your child, and that I flay you open like flecked fish, and then do me as well”, after which he went outside to pass water, which opportunity his mistress used to take flight with her child, going to the farm of the farmer David Villier. When she was some way from the house, she saw the prisoner looking for her amongst the bushes outside the house and, shortly thereafter, also heard to the side of her house a shot going off and, some time thereafter, much smoke and fume going up from the house, all of which she made known on her arrival at the farm of the said Villier, who immediately set out there.</p>
<p>That when the prisoner returned to the house and found his mistress missing, he went outside to search for her amongst the bushes, but when he could not find her, he again went to the house and into the room in order, according to what he says, to shoot himself, but through which the bedding caught fire, which he wanted to drag out but, because of his drunkenness, was unable to do so. The prisoner went outside the house and, when he saw some of the neighbours coming, went to the dry rivulet by the house and tried to cut his throat there, but was taken prisoner while busy doing this by the said neighbours, and was thus delivered into the hands of justice.</p>
<p>And since such unprecedented atrocities cannot be punished severely enough in a country where law and justice are practised.</p>
<p>So it is, that the honourable Council of Justice of this government, serving today, having seen and read with attention the written <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-244">crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-244"><span class="header">crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie</span>Literally ‘criminal demand and conclusion.’ The document drawn up by the prosecutor based on the evidence he collected and delivered in court against an accused. The <em>conclusie</em> is the final part of the document in which the prosecutor suggested an appropriate punishment for the crime.</span></em> drawn up for and delivered for and against the prisoner by the landdrost, <em>Sieur</em> Pieter Lourensz, in his official capacity, besides having noted the prisoner’s voluntary, verified confession and everything else which further served the case, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the free United Netherlands and, having judged the prisoner Cupido van Mallabaar, their honours are sentencing him with this: to be taken to the place where criminal sentences are usually executed here, there to be handed over to the executioner and to be tied onto a cross, to be broken alive from the bottom up, without the <em>coup de grâce</em>, to remain lying thus on the cross until he has given up the ghost, thereafter the dead body to be dragged to the outer place of execution, to be placed upon a wheel and to remain lying on this until being consumed by the air and the birds of heaven; the Council further sentences the prisoner to the costs and expenditure of justice.</p>
<p>Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 28 May 1739, as well as pronounced and executed on the 30<sup>th</sup> of this month.<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-2" id="d0-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>

<p>According to Haafner, who lived at the Cape between 1767 and 1770, it was very common in the Dutch colonies ‘dat men aan de huisslaven, ten einde hun het bezoeken van vreemde slavinnen te beletten en meer aan het huis van hunnen meester te verbinden, eene slavin uit het huis toevoegt, die met elkander zamenwonen en ook wederzijds vrij getrouw zijn, hetgene men dan zijne slaven uittrouwen noemt’ (that, in order to prevent other female slaves from visiting, and to attach their own slaves more to the house of their masters, one would give a female slave from the household to house slaves, who would live together, and who would also be fairly faithful to each other; which system is called marrying out one’s slaves) (Haafner 1992: 74). Not buying a female slave for Cupido obviously did not ‘attach’ him to the house of his owner. <a href="#d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>Dat hij gevangen, na sulx verrigt te hebben, teegens sijn gemelte lijfvrouw nog gesegt heeft: Het soude beeter weesen, dat ik jouw, jouw man, en jouw kind vermoorde, en openvlekte als een vlek vis, en dan mij ook; gaande voorts naar buijten om zijn waater af te slaan, welke geleegentheijt zijn gevangens lijfvrouw waarneemende met haar kind de vlugt nam, begeevende sig naer de plaats van den landbouwer David Villier, siende zij, soo als een endweegs van huijs was, dat den gevangen buijtens huijs in de bosjes na haer sogte, ook hoorde zij kort daeraan naar de kant van haar huijs een schoot doen, en een wijnig daarna sag sij een groote rook en damp van haar huijs opgaan, alle hetwelke zij bij haare aankomst op de plaats van gemelte Villier heeft bekent gemaakt, die sig ook aanstonds derwaerts heeft begeeven.</p>
