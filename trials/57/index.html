  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>This is a case of a slave who was caught in the midst of a matrimonial dispute between her owners. Nicolaas Heijns hit Flora several times, causing severe wounds to her head, for reasons which were not clear to any of those who witnessed the scene. She complained to the authorities, and the supporting testimonies, which included those of Heijns’s son, seemed to back Flora’s claims. The fiscal was sympathetic, calling for Heijn’s punishment with a fine. But Heijns’s claims to the Court of Justice that his wife had put Flora up to making the complaint gave them pause for thought and Heijns does not appear to have been penalised.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The case contains some incidental details of interest, such as Flora’s job of selling almonds in the streets of Cape Town, a task at which she had little success,<sup><a href="#summary-fn-2" id="summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> and her role of serving at table in the Heijns household.</p>

<ol>
<li id="summary-fn-1">
<p>Heijns was brought before the court on 13 February 1766, and claimed both that Flora ‘seer brutaal teegens mij geweest’ (was most insolent towards me) and that his wife had done everything in her power to oppose him, including inciting his slaves against him and encouraging Flora van Bengalen to make her complaint to the authorities. He produced a letter written to him by his wife, which was full of insults and curses (printed in Ponelis 1993: 79 and, in Afrikaans translation, in Schoeman 2002a: 76; Raidt 1994: 196 and 202 discusses its linguistic features). The court stated that this had nothing to do with the case, which was concerned with whether or not Heijns had maltreated Flora. Heijns admitted that he had hit her, ‘dog dat het in sijne drift geweest, en daarin door de assurantie dier slavin gebragt was’ (but that this was in anger and that he had been brought to it because of the insolence of this slave). The court held the case over, but there is no record that it came before them again, CJ 48, f. 25. <a href="#summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em>, by the name of Flora van Bengale, bondswoman of the defendant, the burgher Nicolaas Godfried Heijns,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> brought a complaint to the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-710">eijscher</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-710"><span class="header">eijscher</span>Literally ‘claimant’ or ‘petitioner.’ The prosecutor who drew up and delivered the <em>crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie</em>, usually either the fiscal or a landdrost (magistrate).</span></em>, viz. that, shortly before noon, her said owner suddenly came into the kitchen from the room where he, without her being aware of this, had been lying asleep, when he, not only without any cause and merely under the pretext of saying: “Why do you shout like that! I cannot sleep!”, first gave her a few slaps with his hand, but also, shortly thereafter, when she was standing in the kitchen by the hearth, the defendant again came to her from the room and hit her with an iron ash shovel on the right-hand side of her head in such a way that the blood came streaming from the inflicted wound so that she became faint due to the heavy bleeding. Yet, a short while thereafter, the defendant even returned for a third time from the room and tried to give her a second blow with the same ash shovel, but was, however, prevented from doing this through the intervention of his son, Hendrik, who said that she, Flora, was already bleeding heavily from the first blow she had received. Which can be seen in greater detail in the statement of the wounded slave Flora, attached herewith under the letter A.<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-2" id="d0-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>For which reason the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-711">eijscher</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-711"><span class="header">eijscher</span>Literally ‘claimant’ or ‘petitioner.’ The prosecutor who drew up and delivered the <em>crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie</em>, usually either the fiscal or a landdrost (magistrate).</span></em> considered it prudent to send this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-712">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-712"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour.

Which is when, as shown in the statement of the second chief surgeon, attached herewith under the letter D, it was found that the deep wound, fully two fingers big, caused by the aforementioned blow given to this slave, penetrated the top part of the back skull on the right-hand side, exposing its bone, being accompanied with heavy bleeding and bruising of the surrounding parts.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-713">eijscher</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-713"><span class="header">eijscher</span>Literally ‘claimant’ or ‘petitioner.’ The prosecutor who drew up and delivered the <em>crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie</em>, usually either the fiscal or a landdrost (magistrate).</span></em> also, in order to be more fully informed of the truth and circumstances of this case, and whether or not it squares with the truth, viz. that the defendant had given the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-714">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-714"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour.

In which your honours too will be able to see most clearly the anger and wrath of the defendant.</p>
<p>In this way the defendant has entirely exceeded the level of chastisement which is permitted to an owner in accordance with our laws, viz. to punish his slaves with the hand, stick or <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-715">sjambok</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-715"><span class="header">sjambok</span>This word entered seventeenth-century Dutch via Malay (<em>tjambok</em>) or Javanese (<em>sambok</em>) from Persian (<em>châbuk</em>).

<p>Exhibit in court, 13 February in the year 1766.</p>
<p><strong>CJ 387</strong> Criminele Process Stukken, 1766, ff. 129-31.</p>
<p>Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Jan Willem Cloppenburg, by the slave Flora van Bengalen, bondswoman of the burgher Nicolaas Godfried Heijns, going as follows:</p>
<p>That on a certain morning, at about ten o’clock, one month ago now at a guess, without knowing the precise day or date, the testifier went out, on the order of her mistress, to sell green almonds and then arrived back home after eleven o’clock when her mistress came from the front room to her in the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-718">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-718"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch). In most houses this was a room, although in the later design of some Cape houses it referred to a narrower passage (like a hall or vestibule) flanked by one or more front rooms.</span></em> and asked the testifier if she had sold anything. When the testifier answered this with: “No”, her mistress ordered her to go to the kitchen.</p>
<p>That while the testifier was busy in the kitchen, her owner who, without her knowing this, had been lying asleep in the front room, suddenly came from that room and gave her about three slaps with his hand, saying: “Why are you screaming like this, I cannot sleep”.</p>
<p>That her said owner then returned to the front room, while the testifier remained in the kitchen, but that, shortly thereupon, he again came from that room into the kitchen and went to the testifier, who was standing at the hearth in the presence of both her owner’s sons, Hendrik and Nicolaas, and on this occasion hit a hole in the right-hand side of her head with an iron ash shovel lying there; whereupon her owner went back to the room for the second time, but shortly thereafter returned to the kitchen and tried to deal the testifier a second blow with the ash shovel.</p>
<p>That the testifier’s owner – who had been prevented from accomplishing this by his aforementioned son Hendrik, who said that the testifier was already bleeding from the first blow – then ordered her to serve at the table upon which the testifier’s fellow slave Dela had meanwhile laid the meal; but that the testifier, because the blood streamed from the inflicted wound down her face, became faint and, on the repeated threat of her owner, went to the room and stood there leaning against the post of the door.</p>
<p>That the testifier remained standing in the door of the room during the meal, with the wound continuing to bleed steadily, that after the meal her owner had his aforementioned son Hendrik cut her hair and wash out the wound with brandy, which did not, however, succeed in stanching the blood; for which reason the testifier lodged her complaint concerning this with the honourable petitioner.</p>
<p>There being nothing more to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of her statement as in the text, with presentation to subsequently confirm the same, if so required.</p>
<p>Thus related at the office of the secretary of justice of the Castle of Good Hope on 30 January 1766 in the presence of the clerks Jochem Hendk. Borgwedel and Pieter Caspar Broedersz, as witnesses, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the testifier and me, the sworn clerk.</p>
<p>Which I declare, [signed] L.S. Faber, sworn clerk.</p>
<p><strong>CJ 387</strong> Criminele Process Stukken, 1766, ff. 129-31.</p>
<p>Today, 3 February 1766, there appears before me, Lucas Sigismundus Faber, sworn clerk in the office of the secretary of justice of this government, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the slave Dela van Bengalen, belonging to the burgher Nicolaas Godfried Heijns, of competent age, who, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Jan Willem Cloppenburg, declares it to be true:</p>
<p>That fully a month ago now, probably on a certain Monday, without however being able to remember the date, the deponent’s fellow slave, Flora van Bengalen, went out in the morning to sell green almonds, and returned home again at eleven o’clock, when she stood in the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-719">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-719"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch). In most houses this was a room, although in the later design of some Cape houses it referred to a narrower passage (like a hall or vestibule) flanked by one or more front rooms.</span></em> and reported about the sale of these almonds to her <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-720">juffrouw</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-720"><span class="header">juffrouw</span>Strictly speaking this contraction of <em>jonkvrouw</em> was the form of address for a noble lady (as with <em>jonker</em>, the contraction of <em>jonkheer</em>, ‘lord’), but at the Cape it was more generally used by settlers for women with some social status. Moreover, in the eighteenth century this was also the term slaves used to address their female owners, alongside <em>nonje</em>.</span></em>, the wife of the aforementioned Heijns, who was sitting in the room.</p>
<p>That the reporter’s owner, who had been lying in that room on a bed, and who was somewhat drunk, thereupon started swearing and, while the aforementioned Flora went to the kitchen, got up from the bed and also went to the kitchen, which is when the said owner of the deponent, as soon as he had entered through the kitchen door, asked the aforementioned Flora whether she knew he had been sleeping on the bed in the room.</p>
<p>That when Flora answered: “No” to this, the deponent’s owner gave the said Flora about four slaps in her face. When the aforementioned slave then retreated to the hearth, which was at the other side of the kitchen, the deponent’s owner took up an ash shovel lying by the hearth, and gave the said Flora a blow with it on the right-hand side of her head, whereupon the deponent’s owner wanted to continue with a further blow, but was prevented from it by his son, Hendrik Heijns, who grabbed his hand while saying: “Oh, father”.</p>
<p>That the deponent’s said owner then went to the room, sat down at the table, on which the deponent had meanwhile laid the meal, and called the slave Flora from the kitchen to come and serve at the table. However, the said Flora, who was bleeding heavily from the blow she had received on her head, became faint, and stood leaning with her head against one of the posts [of the door], which is when the aforementioned owner of the deponent asked Flora if she wanted to have a second blow, but that she answered: “No” to this. When the deponent’s owner had eaten and afterwards went to rest, his son, by the name of Hendrik, cut Flora’s hair from her head and cleaned her wound with wine, but since this bleeding could not be stanched, Flora went from the house out of fear and went to the honourable petitioner in order to complain about this incident.</p>
<p>There being nothing more to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of her statement as in the text, with presentation to subsequently confirm the same.</p>
<p>Thus recorded at the office of the secretary of justice of the Castle of Good Hope in the presence of the clerks Pieter Caspar Broedersz and Frederik Wilhelm Allemann, as witnesses, who have signed the original of this together with the deponent and me, the sworn clerk.</p>
<p>Which I declare, [signed] L.S. Faber, sworn clerk.</p>

<p>Nicolaas Godfried Heijns was a troublesome character. Born in 1725 as the son of a free black woman and a German settler, he was organist of the Cape Town church, but was sacked in 1753 because of his ‘obstinacy’ and ‘insolence’ (Leibbrandt 1905: 253-56). In 1764 he married his second wife Alida Maria de Swart, but they had ‘marriage problems’ and around the time of this incident got separated. It seems as if Heyns lived as a music teacher, but he died indigent. He later played a role in the Patriotten movement of the 1780s (Beyers 1967: 126-28). <a href="#d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>Edelachtbare heer en heeren,</p>
<p>Tot verificatie van dit dictum heeft den <em>ex officio</em> eijsscher d’ eer u edelachtbare ter kennisse te brengen dat op den 10<sup>e</sup> der jongst gepasseerde maand Januarij een slaven meijd, in naam Flora van Bengalen, lijfeijgene van den gedaagden burger, Nicolaas Godfried Heijns, bij den eijsscher klagten ingebragt heeft dat even gedagte haar lijfheer kort voor de middag schielijk uijt de kamer, alwaar hij te slaapen gelegen had, zonder dat zij Flora zulks wist, in de kombuijs gekomen wesende, haar niet alleen zonder eenige oorsaak, en slegts onder ’t pretext, op ’t zeggen: Waarom schreeuw je soo! Ik kan niet slaapen!, eerst een paar klappen met de hand gegeven, egter kort daarop, wanneer zij in de kombuijs bij den vuurhaard stond, en den gedaagde voor de tweede maal uijt de kamer bij haar gekomen was, met een ijzere asschop soodanig een gat aan de regter zeijde van ’t hoofd geslagen had, dat het bloed tappelings uijt de g’infligeerde wonde geloopen, en zij door ’t sterk bloeden flaeuw geworden was. Maar dat den gedaagde ook, een kort poosje daarna, voor de derdemaal uijt de kamer gereverteert wesende, getragt had haar nog een tweede slag met dezelfde asschop toe te brengen, dog, door de tusschenkomst van des gedaagden [<em>sic</em>] zoon Hendrik, onder ’t zeggen dat zij Flora door den ontfangen eersten slag reets sterk bloedde, daarin was verhindert geworden. Omstandiger te zien bij het, <em>sub littera</em> A, hiernevens g’annecteerde relaas van de gequetste slavin Flora.</p>
<p>Weshalven den eijsscher raadsaamst heeft g’oordeelt deze meijd naar de ghijzelkamer<sup><a href="#d0-dutch-fn-1" id="d0-dutch-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> te zenden, en dezelve aldaar door een opperchirurgijn uijt ’s edele Compagnies hospitaal te laten verbienden [<em>sic</em>]. Als wanneer, uijtwijsens de, onder <em>littera</em> D, hierbij gevoegde, chirurgicale verklaaring van den tweeden oppermeester bevonden is dat de, door den voorverhaalden slag, aan die slavin toegebragte diepe wonde, ter lengte van ruijm twee vingeren breedte, aan de bovenkant des agterhoofds beens, ter regter zeijde, met ontblooting desselfs beens, verzelt met zwaare bloedinge en kneusinge der ommeleggende deelen, gepenetreert is.</p>
<p>Hebbende den eijsscher daarenboven nog, omme van de waarheijd en toedragt dezer saak, dan wel of het ook met de waarheijd quadreerde, dat den gedaagde die meijd met een asschop den slag toegebragt, en zij dus de wonde ontfangen had, wat nader g’informeert te sijn, de, <em>sub litteris</em> B en C hierbij gevoegde, declaratoiren van des gedaagden [<em>sic</em>] huijsgenooten, die maar allen daarbij present geweest sijn en aan dewelke het best bekent was, ingewonnen; zulks u edelachtbare des gedaagden woede en gramstoorigheijd daaruijt ten klaarsten mede zullen kunnen b’oogen.</p>
<p>Den gedaagde dus de maate der kastijdinge – die volgens onse wetten aan een lijfheer, met de hand, stok of sjambok etc. tegens zijne slaaven wel, maar geensints omme dezelven te mishandelen, ofte ten bloede te quetsen [<em>sic</em>] met asschoppen, of andere diergelijken instrumenten, toegestaan werd – ten eenemaale te buijten gegaan hebbende, zelfs in soo verre, dat die slag wel een doodwonde had kunnen geven, ten minsten den dood, door een daarbij koomend accident, soo wanneer niet in tijds daarna gezien geworden was, ligtelijk daarop had kunnen volgen, nademaalen het, uijt de wonde gevloeide, bloet quaalijk heeft kunnen gestelpt werden, en ook reets flaeuwtens daarop gevolgt sijn; soo vermeijnt den eijsscher amptshalven tegens den gedaagden, met goed regt, te moogen en moeten concludeeren; soo als:</p>
<p>Concludeert bij dezen, dat den gedaagde, Nicolaas Godfried Heijns, bij definitive vonnisse van u edelachtbare mag werden gecondemneert: in een pecunieele amende van eenhondert rijxdaalers <em>pro fisco</em>, en daarenbooven in judicio scherpelijk gereprimendeert te werden, met condemnatie in de kosten; en dat vervolgens de slavenmeijd Flora, ten profijte van den gedaagde, sodaanig publiquelijk zal werden verkogt, dat dezelve nooit ofte ooit wederom in handen van den gedaagden ofte de zijnen kome te vervallen.

<p>A <em>gijzelkamer</em> is not a prison cell: <em>gijzelen</em> means to keep under arrest for a short period, usually in civil cases (e.g. until a debt has been paid); in effect a place where one was kept under guard (see Diederiks 1992: 30-1). It is not known where this was situated, presumably within the Castle and perhaps close to where the fiscal had his offices. <a href="#d0-dutch-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>
