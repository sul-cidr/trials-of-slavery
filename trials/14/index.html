<p>The gang had been active in the area for several months, and alarmed the authorities so much that a massive commando of ninety men was sent out to capture them (Penn 1999: 85-6). Nineteen slaves were charged with criminal activities, which included theft, cattle theft, conspiracy to murder, housebreaking, violent robbery, public disorder and maintenance of slave runaways. The <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-118">eijsch</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-118"><span class="header">eijsch</span>Literally ‘claim’ or ‘demand.’ This is strictly speaking the <em>eijsch ende conclusie</em> without the final part about sentencing, but the term is often used as a shorthand for the whole document.</span></em> covers eighty pages, and the documentation includes a <em>sententie</em>, CJ 785, ff. 12-55, and the testimonies of the accused, as well as a number of witnesses, CJ 330, ff. 475-982. One slave died in prison during the proceedings, three were hanged, and the remaining fifteen were whipped and branded, and then returned to their owners with the stipulation that they work in chains for four years (for eight of them) or three years (for the remaining seven), CJ 9, ff. 47-8 [1726]. <a href="#summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>Biewenga (1999: 110) cites this as an example of slave loyalty to their owners. Certainly everyone inside the farmstead, including the slaves, were under attack, and Scipio refused to join the runaways, although it may be, considering this was a statement to the judicial authorities, that he was particularly keen to emphasise his opposition to those facing serious criminal charges. <a href="#summary-fnref-3" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>This may have been because he was in a position of chief authority on the widow’s farm and was defending the house with his gun, but the runaways’ concern to capture him might suggest a deeper motive. Aaron van Bengalen, one of the attackers, was owned by Ten Damme and worked on her cattle outpost, so is likely to have come under Adam van Dijk’s command. As overseers, <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-119">knechten</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-119"><span class="header">knechten</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> were often the focus of slave resentment (see 1761 Johan Spring in ’t Veld, n. 1). Aaron had proposed to his fellow runaways that they should break into the house, tie up the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-120">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-120"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> and murder him before stealing its contents, but while some agreed, others responded that they only needed to tie him up, not to kill him, CJ 785, ff. 33-4. Clearly Aaron bore Adam van Dijk a particular grudge, as is borne out by the testimony of Schipper van de Cust Coromandel, who claims that Aaron van Bengalen told his fellow runaways when they wanted to take some of the plates in the house: ‘mijn juffrouws goed moeten wij niet meede neemen, maar de knegts goed wel, die heeft mijn bloed gesoogen, ik sal het zijne ook weder zuijgen’ (we must not take my <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-121">juffrouw</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-121"><span class="header">juffrouw</span>Strictly speaking this contraction of <em>jonkvrouw</em> was the form of address for a noble lady (as with <em>jonker</em>, the contraction of <em>jonkheer</em>, ‘lord’), but at the Cape it was more generally used by settlers for women with some social status.

<p>That the testifier is stationed on the farm of his mistress, named the Brakke Fontain, and when, on a certain Saturday evening at ten o’clock, at his guess, he – as also the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-123">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-123"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em>, named Adam van Dijk, and the slaves Schipper and Floris – had gone to sleep in the house there, there was soft knocking on the back door of the house. That the testifier, who was still half drowsy, heard that there was even louder banging on the door, whereupon he asked who was knocking on the door, that from the outside a certain Aaron van Bengalen, belonging to his owner and being stationed at the post at Coeberg, said to him: “Come on, open the door”, without the testifier opening the door at that time, though he did hear a person standing at the outside saying: “You damned fool, why do you not break open the door?” That thereupon the door was broken open, without being able to say whether this was done with an axe or a hatchet, though he did see in the morning that something sharp had been used to hack at and into the door; and because of this noise the aforementioned <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-124">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-124"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> Adam van Dijk came from his bedroom to the testifier and the slave Schipper in the kitchen and said to them: “Who the hell is banging on the door like that?”, and intended, without having a gun with him, to go outside the door to see who was there, [but] was kept back by the testifier, who said to him: “They are not good people, you must not go outside”. That the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-125">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-125"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> thereupon went back to his bedroom, telling the testifier to make some light, which he did by lighting both a candle in the room as well as a lamp in the kitchen. The <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-126">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-126"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> Adam van Dijk loaded two muskets and a pair of pistols with shot, giving one of the first-mentioned to the slave named Schipper, with the order to watch carefully that nobody entered the house or fired at them.</p>
<p>That a certain slave Floris, also belonging to <em>Juffrouw</em> Ten Damme, who slept in a lean-to room,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> woke up from the aforesaid noise and, (according to his own story) being surprised, tried to run away, to which end he opened a window in the aforesaid lean-to room, and when he noticed that there were two persons armed with muskets and who were taking aim at the window with the muzzles of the same, he jumped back and informed the aforementioned <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-127">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-127"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> of this.</p>
<p>The testifier declares that when the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-128">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-128"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> had been told this by Floris, he saw this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-129">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-129"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> shooting open a window of that lean-to room with a pistol, after having first warned the persons standing outside that they should give themselves up as prisoners. That thereupon the said <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-130">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-130"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> went to the hacked door, and that, when a shot was fired from the outside around the window, this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-131">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-131"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> also fired a shot with the pistol at the broken door. That thereupon the aforenamed <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-132">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-132"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> said to the slaves in the house: “<em>Jongens</em>, I must flee, let them take what they want”, whereupon this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-133">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-133"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em>, wearing only a blue nightshirt, fled through this broken door past several slaves, who were standing in front of it, and who were fugitives, being immediately followed by all these slaves calling: “Pege, pege” or, in other words: “Seize him, seize him”.</p>

At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> shortly afterwards again came to the house, except for the aforementioned Aaron van Bengalen, who returned about half an hour after this, being covered in mud, and who dried himself there in the house by the fire.</p>
<p>That while he and the slaves of his mistress were standing in the kitchen, the fugitives – amongst whom he knows by name: the aforementioned Aaron van Bengalen, Benjamin of Jan Mostert, as well as Hercules of the same, and Jacob of Thobias Mostert – went into the room of the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-135">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-135"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em>, [where] one of the same slaves broke or hacked open the chest of the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-136">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-136"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em>, without him knowing who it was; nevertheless, that a big <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-137">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-137"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

Further, that they stole with the others from this room: half a <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-138">mud</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-138"><span class="header">mud</span>A measurement for dry goods, usually wheat or flour, the equivalent of about one hectolitre.</span></em> of flour, one <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-139">schepel</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-139"><span class="header">schepel</span>One <em>mud</em> (one hectolitre) contained four <em>schepels</em>.</span></em> of rice, six loaves of bread, two muskets, two pistols, four pewter table plates, and that they then stole from the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-140">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-140"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> Adam van Dijk the or, in fact, all of his goods, which were gathered into a bundle by the fugitives and carried through the door, without him being able to say of what it consisted, but he does know that the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-141">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-141"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> had owned shirt and jacket buttons of gold and silver.</p>
<p>That with the return of the fugitives, after they had pursued the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-142">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-142"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em>, the slave Schipper wanted to shoot at them, yet that the testifier had dissuaded him from doing this, since he was afraid that the same might murder them, testifying also, apart from this, that when Aaron van Bengalen came to the farm, he had at least twice said: “It grieves me not having got the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-143">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-143"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em>”. That Jacob of Tobias Mostert had urged him, the testifier, as well as his fellow slaves, to also run away, yet that this was refused and declined by them.</p>
<p>All of which testified above, is declared by the deponent to be the whole truth, asserting to be convinced of its accuracy as given in the text, while offering to subsequently confirm all of the above, if necessary.</p>
<p>Thus done and testified at the Cape of Good Hope on 27 May 1726, in the presence of the assistants Martinus Heems and Johannes Henricus Blanckenberg, requested hereto as witnesses of faith.</p>

<p>Dat hij relateur beschijden weesende op zijn meesteresses plaats genaamt de Brakke Fontain, wanneer hij relateur op seekeren Zaturdag avond, beneevens den knegt, Adam van Dijk genaamt, en de slaven Schipper en Floris, aldaar ten huijse te slapen begeeven hadden, omtrent, naar zijn gissing, de clokke thien uuren, aan de agter deur van ’t huijs sagtjes aangeklopt is geworden. Dat hij relateur, nog half in sluijmering zijnde, gehoord heeft dat er nog harder op die deur geslagen wierd, waarop hij relateur gevraagd heeft wie ’r aan de deur klopte, dat hem van buijten daarop door eenen Aaron van Bengalen, zijner lijfvrouw toebehoorende en op de post aan de Coeberg beschijden weesende, gesegt is geworden: Doet de deur maar open, sonder dat hij relateur alsdoen de deur opengemaakt heeft, maar wel gehoord te hebben dat door een buijten staande persoon gezegt is geworden: Jouw donders kind, waarom sla’ je de deur niet oopen? Dat daarop de deur open geslagen is geworden, sonder te kunnen seggen of het met een bijl of capmes geschied is, maar des morgens wel gesien te hebben datter in en op de deur met scherp gekapt was, door welkers gerugt den voornoemde knegt Adam van Dijk uijt desselfs slaapcamer in de combuijs bij hem relateur en den slaaf Schipper gekomen zijnde, teegens haarlieden heeft gezegt: Wie donder klopt ’er soo op de deur?; dewelke, sonder eenig geweer bij sig te hebben, van meening zijnde buijten de deur te gaan omme te sien wie ’r was, door hem relateur is terug gehouden, seggende: ’t Is geen goet volk, jij moet niet buijten gaan. Dat die knegt daarop weder in zijn slaapcamer gaande, teegen hem relateur heeft gezegt dat hij ligt soude opsteeken, ’tgeen door hem relateur, soowel caars in de camer als lamp in de combuijs, gedaan zijnde, de knegt Adam van Dijk twee snaphaanen en een paar pistoolen, met hagel geladen heeft, geevende van de eerstgenoemde eene aan de aldaar zijnde mede slaaf, Schipper genaamt, met ordre omme wel gade te slaan dat niemand in huijs quam, ofte daarop los te branden.</p>
<p>Dat seekere slaaf Floris, toebehoorende insgelijx juffrouw Ten Damme, dewelke in een afdak sliep, op ’t voortzeijde gerugt ontwaakt zijnde, (volgens desselfs eijge verhaal) verbaast zijnde, getragt heeft weg te loopen, ende ten dien einde in ’t voorszeijde afdak een vengster hadde open gemaakt, en wanneer hij ontwaarde dat ’er twee persoonen waaren die met snaphaanen gewapent, met de trompen derselve in de vengster aanlaagen, terug is gesprongen en daarvan kennisse aan de knegt, meergemelt, hadde gegeeven.</p>
<p>Betuijgende den relateur dat wanneer den knegt hetselve door Floris bekent gemaakt was, hij gesien heeft dat dien knegt met een pistool een vengster van dat afdak heeft open geschooten, naar dat alvoorens die buijtenstaande persoonen gewaarschouwt hadde sig gevangen te geeven. Dat daarop den gezegde knegt naar de gekapte deur gegaan weesende, en dat van buijten een schoot omtrent de vengster gedaan zijnde, die knegt ook een schoot met den pistool op de gebrookene deur heeft gedaan. Dat daarop de knegt, meergenoemt, teegens de slaven daar ten huise gezegt heeft: Jongens, ik moet vlugten, laat zij neemen wat zij willen, en waarop die knegt, enkel een blauw hembd aanhebbende, uijt de gebrookene deur door etlijke slaven, die voor die deur stonden en fugativen waren, de vlugt heeft genoomen, werdende immediaat vervolgt door alle die slaven onder het geroep van: Pege, pege<sup><a href="#d0-dutch-fn-1" id="d0-dutch-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>, ofte wel anders: Vat hem, vat hem.</p>
<p>Dat alle de jongens kort naar dato daar weder ten huijse zijn gekomen, exepto Aaron van Bengalen, voornoemt, dewelke omtrent een half uur naar dato, seer bemodderd zijnde, ook weder is gereverteerd, en die sig daar ten huijse bij ’t vuur heeft gedroogt.</p>
<p>Dat hij en zijne meesteresses slaven in de combuijs staande, de fugativen, waaronder hij met name kent: Aaron van Bengalen, voornoemt, Benjamin van Jan Mostert, alsmede Hercules van ditto, en Jacob van Thobias Mostert, in de camer van de knegt zijn gegaan, door eene derselve slaven de kist van de knegt is opengebrooken of gekapt, sonder te weeten door wien, dog dat een groote jongen, dien hij mede niet weet te noemen, met de snaphaan haar gedrijgd heeft, ingevalle zij eenig tegenstand deeden, haar te sullen massacreeren. Dat zij voorts uijt die camer met den anderen gestoolen hebben: een half mudde meel, een scheepel rijst, ses brooden, twee snaphaanen, twee pistoolen, vier tinne tafelborden, en dat vervolgens van de knegt Adam van Dijk de meeste, ofte wel alle de, goederen zijn ontstoolen, dewelke in een bondel gewonden zijnde door de fugativen ten deure uijtgedragen zijn, sonder dat hij comparant<sup><a href="#d0-dutch-fn-2" id="d0-dutch-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> weet te zeggen waar [<em>onleesbaar</em>] de selve hebben bestaan, maar wel te weeten dat de knegt goude en zilveren hembd en hembrok knoopjes heeft gehad.</p>
<p>Dat den slaaf Schipper op de wederkomst van de fugativen, wanneer de knegt vervolgt hadden, wel op haar heeft willen schieten, dog dat hij relateur hem sulxs heeft afgeraden, nademaal bedugt was dat dezelve haarlieden selfs mogten om den hals brengen, betuijgende daarneevens nog dat wanneer Aaron van Bengalen op de plaats gekomen is, tot twee maalen toe gezegt heeft: Het is mij leet dat ik de knegt niet gekreegen heb. Dat Jacob van Tobias Mostert hem relateur, soo wel als zijn mede slaven, heeft aangesprooken om ook weg te loopen, dog dat door haar sulxs is gewijgert en afgeslagen geworden.</p>
<p>Alle ’tgeene voorszeijde staat verclaard en relateert den comparant te zijn de suijvere waarheid, geevende voor reedenen van wetenschap als in den text, met presentatie alle ’t voorenstaande, desnoods, nader te willen affirmeeren.</p>
<p>Aldus gedaan en gerelateert aan Cabo de Goede Hoop, den 27<sup>e</sup> Maij 1726, ten overstaan van de assistenten Martinus Heems en Johannes Henricus Blanckenberg, als getuijgen van geloove hiertoe verzogt.</p>

<p>Portuguese, the imperative form of <em>pegar</em>, ‘to seize, nab [a thief]’. All but one of the nineteen slaves who testified in this case came from South or Southeast Asia, and although four of them testified in Malay, it is likely that they communicated with one another in Portuguese (Franken 1953: 51-2).
