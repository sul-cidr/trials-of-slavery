It is not clear whether Alexander was acquitted because the court had some sympathy with his circumstances or because the evidence was unclear. It is striking that, although rejecting the death sentence, the court did not impose any punishment at all, but neither did it order him to be sold to prevent his owner from retaliation, as was usually done in such cases.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-3" id="summary-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>

<p>That on a certain Saturday in the month February, without however knowing the exact date, the deponent was on his master’s farm, situated around Klapmuts, when his master ordered him around midday to tie up a certain slave of his, named Alexander, without the deponent being aware of the reasons.</p>
<p>That the deponent tied up this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-319">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-319"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

Shortly thereafter there came to him in the wagon-house (where he was busy putting together a wagon) one of his master’s slaves, named Pieter, who said to the deponent: “It is good that you have come from over the mountain,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-2" id="d0-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> because that <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-320">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-320"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em>”, to which the deponent replied: “My God! That must not be”, after which he again went to the kitchen, where he heard his master speaking very loudly to this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-322">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-322"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>Interrogation, in which is to be heard and questioned, on the requisition of the landdrost Pieter Lourensz, the slave Alexander van Couchin, bondsman of the former <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-325">heemraad</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-325"><span class="header">heemraad</span>The origin of this word is uncertain, but is connected to the Dutch words <em>heem</em> (‘homestead’) and <em>raad</em> (‘councillor’). This was the title of a free burgher who served on the <em>Collegie van Heemraden</em> in the rural districts of the Cape, usually for a term of two years.</span></em>, Daniel van der Lith.</p>
<p>There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the slave Alexander van Couchin, who responded to the questions below as are noted in their margins.</p>
<p>Article 1: What is the prisoner’s name, age and place of birth?</p>
<p>Answer: Alexander van Couchin, 40 years old at a guess.</p>
<p>Article 2: Whose bondsman the prisoner is and where he was stationed here?</p>
<p>Answer: Bondsman of the former <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-326">heemraad</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-326"><span class="header">heemraad</span>The origin of this word is uncertain, but is connected to the Dutch words <em>heem</em> (‘homestead’) and <em>raad</em> (‘councillor’). This was the title of a free burgher who served on the <em>Collegie van Heemraden</em> in the rural districts of the Cape, usually for a term of two years.</span></em> Daniel van der Lith and to have lived on his farm situated around Clapmuts.</p>
<p>Article 3: If, on the afternoon of Saturday the 18<sup>th</sup> of the recently past month February, when the prisoner was sitting and eating in the kitchen on his owner’s farm situated around Clapmuts, he was tied up by the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-327">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-327"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> Christoffel on the order of his aforementioned master?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 4: If, during this tying up, the prisoner had put an unsheathed knife, which he had held in his hand, in his pocket, and if the same had been taken out again from there by the slave Marinus?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 5: If, when the slave Aurora, likewise on the order of the prisoner’s master, was going to be tied up, she had seized her mistress around her waist and begged for forgiveness?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 6: If, as the prisoner’s mistress then became very upset, his master had him untied again?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 7: If the prisoner, after he had been untied, went to the slave house,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-3" id="d0-translation-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> put on a jacket there, and again went back to the kitchen with the unsheathed knife in the pocket of his trousers?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 8: Where the prisoner had found that knife and with what intention he again returned with it to the kitchen?</p>
<p>Answer: I found my old knife on the window sill in the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-328">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-328"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> house and, with this and a piece of tobacco in my hand, went to the kitchen to cut it there.</p>
<p>Article 9: If it had been to kill his master, or somebody else, with it?</p>
<p>Answer: I did not have this in mind.</p>
<p>Article 10: If, when the prisoner wanted to leave the slave house to go to the kitchen, he had been held back by the slave Marinus, but that the prisoner nonetheless, while saying: “What do you have to do with me, just let me go”, went to the kitchen?</p>
<p>Answer: The old <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-329">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-329"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> Pieter wanted to keep me back, and I said to him then: “I am tired, you just go on to your work, I won’t be coming now”.</p>
<p>Article 11: If, when the prisoner got into the kitchen, his master told him: “Go to your bed and sleep, you have after all come from the Cape and are tired”, and if the prisoner answered to this: “I don’t want to do that”?</p>
<p>Answer: My <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-330">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-330"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’. In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em> ordered me, since I did not want to sleep, to go and fetch a basket with peaches from <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-331">juffrouw</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-331"><span class="header">juffrouw</span>Strictly speaking this contraction of <em>jonkvrouw</em> was the form of address for a noble lady (as with <em>jonker</em>, the contraction of <em>jonkheer</em>, ‘lord’), but at the Cape it was more generally used by settlers for women with some social status. Moreover, in the eighteenth century this was also the term slaves used to address their female owners, alongside <em>nonje</em>.</span></em> Cloeten, to which I answered: “Yes, <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-332">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-332"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’. In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em>, that is good”, and this was done in the presence of the slave of the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-333">heemraad</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-333"><span class="header">heemraad</span>The origin of this word is uncertain, but is connected to the Dutch words <em>heem</em> (‘homestead’) and <em>raad</em> (‘councillor’). This was the title of a free burgher who served on the <em>Collegie van Heemraden</em> in the rural districts of the Cape, usually for a term of two years.</span></em> Cloete, named Isacq.</p>
<p>Article 12: If the prisoner, after his master told him a second time that he should go to bed, again said: “I don’t want to do that” and then went to sit on a chest in the kitchen?</p>
<p>Answer: I know nothing of this.</p>
<p>Article 13: If the prisoner, while speaking to his master, continually advanced towards his master?</p>
<p>Answer: No.</p>
<p>Article 14: If the prisoner did this in order to pierce the same with the knife he had with him?</p>
<p>Answer: No, I did not do that.</p>
<p>Article 15: If the prisoner, shortly after he had left the kitchen for the first time, immediately returned again to the kitchen with a knife in his hand?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, with the old knife and a bit of tobacco.</p>
<p>Article 16: If the prisoner, after he had sharpened the knife on the threshold of the kitchen, said: “Yes knife, you will stab into my soul, or into another soul”?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, I said that because of being disheartened.</p>
<p>Article 17: If the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-334">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-334"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em> Silvia then said to the prisoner: “Fie, <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-335">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-335"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em>, shame upon you, if somebody gets to hear that, you’ll be damned”?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 18: If the prisoner then gave this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-336">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-336"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em> as an answer to this: “That has nothing to do with you, I want my death, just let me be dead”.</p>
<p>Answer: It could well be, but I would not be able to say that for sure.</p>
<p>Article 19: If, after the prisoner again put the knife in his pocket, he went to the slave house and shortly thereafter returned yet again?</p>
<p>Answer: I put the knife down in the kitchen and thereafter went with the slave Isacq of Jacob Cloeten to his master’s house in order to fetch peaches.</p>
<p>Article 20: What the prisoner wanted to do or execute on each occasion in the kitchen with that knife?</p>
<p>Answer: I wanted to cut a piece of tobacco with that knife.</p>
<p>Article 21: For what reasons the prisoner opposed his master in such a fashion and why he wanted to wound the same? Answer: I was not angry with my <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-337">sinjeur</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-337"><span class="header">sinjeur</span>It is uncertain whether <em>sinjeur</em> came into colonial Dutch from French <em>seigneur</em> or Creole Portuguese <em>sinjoor</em> (both from Latin, <em>senior</em>, ‘older’). The word was commonly used by slaves at the Cape to address European males but was also the official title for lower-ranking VOC officials. The word lived on in Afrikaans in the form of <em>seur</em> until the early twentieth century but is now obsolete.</span></em> and I also did not want to wound him.</p>
<p>Article 22: If the prisoner must not admit that he is punishable in the extreme for his maliciousness and atrocious intention?</p>
<p>Answer: I was not malicious towards my master, also I did not have any evil intention against the same.</p>
<p>Thus questioned and answered at the Cape of Good Hope on 6 April 1741 before the honourables Cl. Brand and Jan de Wit, members from the aforementioned Council, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the interrogatee and me, the secretary.</p>
