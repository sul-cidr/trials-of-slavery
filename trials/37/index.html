  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>This is an extraordinary case of an escaped slave who survived on his own unnoticed for twenty years in the mountains around the Franschhoek region. On recapture, he vividly recalled the events which led to his desertion. The daughter he had with the woman he called his wife,<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> Manika van Bengalen, was severely maltreated by their owner’s wife, for unknown reasons. Reijnier was a loyal and long-standing slave, who had built up the farm by his labour, but he was taunted by other slaves for his failure to defend his daughter. He eventually cracked, attacked his owner with a knife and fled to the mountains. Twenty years later he was recaptured. By then his owners and his daughter were dead. Only Manika, now aged 60, survived. For all these years she had not known what had happened to Reijnier or whether he was still alive.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-2" id="summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The case gives a vivid insight into psychological and emotional tensions which slave families could undergo on a remote farm, as well as the ability of an isolated runaway to survive for many years in the surrounding mountains. The story did not have a happy ending: Reijnier was sentenced to labour for life on Robben Island.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-3" id="summary-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Slaves were not permitted to marry until 1823, but in the eighteenth century those who formed permanent relationships were sometimes referred to as <em>vrouw</em> and <em>man</em>. The partnerships had no legal standing, but in the eyes of both the slaves and their owners, these bonds were matter of fact (see 1739 Cupido van Mallabaar, n. 3). Although couples could be separated from each other or from their children, this did not always prevent stable emotional relationships. On slave marriages, see Worden 1985: 57-8; Shell 1994: 288-89 and 320-24; and Schoeman 2001: 534-36 and 559-61; and, on slave families, Heese 1981.

<p>That fully twenty years ago now, the confessant’s daugther, named Sabina, was daily, without any reason, thrashed by the wife of his abovementioned owner, and that his said mistress would not agree, despite the confessant’s frequent entreaties, to sell her under any circumstances but, instead of this, continually maltreated her. As, towards the evening on a certain Saturday, when the confessant came home from ploughing and asked his fellow slave Manica, who was the confessant’s wife, for the used tea leaves of his mistress, this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-487">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-487"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em> answered: “The <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-488">juffrouw</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-488"><span class="header">juffrouw</span>Strictly speaking this contraction of <em>jonkvrouw</em> was the form of address for a noble lady (as with <em>jonker</em>, the contraction of <em>jonkheer</em>, ‘lord’), but at the Cape it was more generally used by settlers for women with some social status. Moreover, in the eighteenth century this was also the term slaves used to address their female owners, alongside <em>nonje</em>.</span></em> drank no tea today, but wine”. The said <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-489">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-489"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em> then narrated to him how that day his mistress, after first undressing the said Sabina and having her spanned into a so-called <em>poolsche bok</em>,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> had again pitifully beaten her with a <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-490">sjambok</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-490"><span class="header">sjambok</span>This word entered seventeenth-century Dutch via Malay (<em>tjambok</em>) or Javanese (<em>sambok</em>) from Persian (<em>châbuk</em>).

At the Cape it was also used to beat draught animals with.</span></em>. For which reason the said Sabina had fled from the house to behind a corral, from where the confessant himself fetched her and brought her into the kitchen. Moreover, as a result of this [beating], the said woman slave then wanted to run away; however, the confessant told her not to do so, but that she should rather go to her owner and beg him for forgiveness. Wherefore the confessant’s fellow slaves, named Hans and Patas, seeing the continual maltreatment of his aforementioned daughter Sabina, often said to him: “You are such an old <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-491">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-491"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> and have helped to pay off this farm, you can plough and do all sorts of other work so well, and yet you can endure such maltreatment – if this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-492">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-492"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour.

In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em> differently”. And that, later on that very same Saturday evening, when both the confessant and the other slaves were all in the kitchen, the confessant’s owner entered it, holding a broomstick in his hand, and beat the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-494">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-494"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour.

As a consequence of this the confessant, out of dejection and grief, took up a knife lying on the table in the kitchen and gave his aforementioned owner three stabs with it, without being able to say where, seeing that the lamp was almost half burnt out. Upon this, the confessant immediately took flight to above the ploughed fields of his owner, where he remained for about one week, and thereafter went from there to the mountains at Franschhoek, at which place he remained for, as best he can remember, a period of sixteen years, after which he proceeded from there to the mountain situated above the farm of Jan du Busson, where he likewise remained some years, and where he was also, some days ago, captured by some Europeans, taken to Stellenbosch and then delivered into the hands of justice.</p>
<p>The confessant declares finally that during all of this time he had not spoken to a single person, and had maintained himself with dassies and fish, which he had caught with implements he manufactured to this end.</p>
<p>Thus confessed in the Dutch language, which the confessant speaks and understands reasonably well, at the Cape of Good Hope on 13 January 1749 before the honourables Cornelis Eelders and Paul Artoijs, members of the aforementioned honourable Council of Justice, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant and me, the sworn clerk.</p>
<p>Verification</p>
<p>There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, Reijnier van Madagascar, who, after this, his given confession, had been read out word by word, clearly and plainly, declares to fully persist by it, therefore not desiring that anything more be added to or taken from it, and declares all of the above to be the whole truth.</p>
<p>Thus verified at the Cape of Good Hope on 14 January 1749 before the honourables Cornelis Eelders and P. Artoijs, members of the aforementioned honourable Council of Justice, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant and me, the sworn clerk.</p>

<p>Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Adriaan van Schoor, by the burgher Pieter Reijnertsz., being of the following contents, namely:</p>
<p>That on Friday, the 3<sup>rd</sup> of this month, the testifier, who has been working for some time on the farm of the farmer Jan du Buisson in Draakensteijn, understood from the cattle herder of the said Jan du Buisson that there must be deserters maintaining themselves in the vicinity of the river or the mountain, which this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-495">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-495"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

That the deponent, together with the brother of the aforesaid Jan du Buisson, named David du Buisson, and a person with the name of Schellenberg, who is a <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-496">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-496"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> of the said Jan du Buisson, went out that very afternoon to the mountain, taking with them, in order to point out this hut, the aforementioned cattle herder and yet another slave of Jan du Buisson. That not far from this hut, they kept watch throughout the night and, when they searched it by day, they found nothing but small snares which had been laid there. However, when they searched together around the area, the aforementioned cattle herder espied a <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-497">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-497"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em>, of which he immediately warned the testifier and the party with him. That they then all went there together, finding, about a couple of hundred paces from the aforementioned hut, towards the Draakensteijn mountains, a slave, who was at once asked by the burgher David du Buisson if he was Reijnier of Matthijs Krugel, to which the same answered: “Yes!”, adding that he had been supporting himself in the mountains for about seven or eight years and that he had maintained himself with trapped dassies and fish from the Berg River, whereupon they took this slave Reijnier prisoner and brough him to the prison in Stellenbosch.</p>
<p>There being nothing more to declare, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing, if it may be required, to subsequently confirm the aforegoing, at any time.</p>
<p>Thus related at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch on 8 January 1749 in the presence of the lay reader Abraham Faure and the messenger of the court Hendrik van Ellewe, requested as witnesses hereto, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the testifier and me, the secretary.</p>
<p>Which I declare, [signed] A. Schephausen, secretary.</p>

<p>The <em>poolsche bok</em> was a way of tying somebody up: the hands are tied together and put over the drawn-up knees, after which a stick or something like it is inserted under the knees and across the arms, thereby rendering a person totally defenseless. Slaves were usually undressed before being tied up like this and then whipped. For an explanation of the name and for further examples of this vicious punishment, see Franken 1953: 109-12. The punishment had been in use at the Cape since the seventeenth century and was also known in colonial Surinam (Stedman 1992: 556 and 665). Franken suggests that it might have developed from a punishment meted out on ships. <a href="#d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>
