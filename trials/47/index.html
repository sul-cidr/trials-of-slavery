  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>Here a Cape Town slave attacked his partner (also a slave), with whom he had had several children, because he saw another slave in the house rocking the cradle of their child and became jealous. He ran away but, without proper clothing and food, was forced to give himself up.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Apart from the nature of the relationships and jealousies between slaves in an urban household, the case contains a number of details of interest. Owners and burghers were entirely absent from the account of the events<sup><a href="#summary-fn-2" id="summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> and there is some rare insight into the emotional feelings of a slave.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-3" id="summary-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> The household also had a specialised slave cook (Schindelaar was a lieutenant-captain and clearly upheld a relatively prosperous lifestyle).<sup><a href="#summary-fn-4" id="summary-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> The weapon used in the attack was a <em>parrang</em>, a Southeast Asian term for a short machete. Januarij could not exist on his own on the mountain without prior preparation, and was able to regain access to the house via a Chinese resident who lived in the outbuildings.</p>

<p>The slaves appear to have been left alone in the house. Both their owner and his wife had recently died, so they may have been looking after the house and child while Schindelaar’s estate was being finalised.

<p>That today in the afternoon, the time two or half past two o’clock at a guess, when the testifier was busy dressing the youngest son of her late owner, she, because her youngest child,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> who was lying in the back room in a cradle, was crying loudly, at that time requested the cook of her former owner, by the name of Augustus, to rock the same. In the meantime, while he was doing this, her fellow slave, named Januarij, with whom she has a relationship, came home; who, when seeing that the said Augustus was rocking her child, asked what the aforementioned Augustus was doing at the cradle, to which she answered that he was rocking her child since it had been crying, adding that she did not know that there was anything wrong with that. The said Januarij then went mumbling and grumbling to the kitchen at the back, saying: “You have a soul, and I have a soul”. However, since, shortly thereafter, this slave came back from the kitchen and went to the front door, locked the same and took the key from the door, the testifier became frightened; for which reason she immediately, with her child on the arm, took the child of her late owner by its hand, and fled with them into the back room, besides closing the door after her. But, as she could not find the key in the door, the testifier could not lock it, because of which she at once jumped through the window into the street, but while she was busy lifting the said child of her owner through the window to her in the street, she was leaped upon by the aforementioned Januarij who, from inside the room, hit her on the outside with a <em>parrang</em> which he held in his hand, so that she instantly received a blow straight on her head, which, however, was largely thwarted by a silver hair pin in her hair, after which he dealt her another blow on the right shoulder, but without being hit deeper than through the clothes; however, as she wanted to prevent further blows with her right hand, she then also received three cuts and wounds on it. In the meantime, the aforementioned little child of her owner had run from the room, while Januarij also jumped through the window and got away by fleeing, taking with him the <em>parrang</em> and the key of the front door.</p>
<p>Thus related at the Cape of Good Hope on 2 November 1755 in the presence of the clerks Otto Wilhelm Rotenburg and Jochem Hendrick Borgwedel, as witnesses, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the testifier and me, the honourable sworn clerk.</p>

<p>Verification</p>
<p>There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the aforementioned honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, Clara van Macassar, who, after this, her given statement, was read out word by word, clearly and plainly, declares to fully persist with it, therefore not desiring that anything more should be added or taken from it; and declares in the presence of the slave Januarij van Boegies all of the above to be the whole truth.</p>
<p>Thus verified at the Cape of Good Hope on 13 November 1755 before the honourables Cl. Brand and Js. Hs. Blankenberg, members of the honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the confessant<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-2" id="d0-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> and me, the secretary.</p>
<p>Which I declare, [signed] Jn. Fr. Tiemmendorf, secretary.</p>
<p><strong>CJ 365</strong> Criminele Process Stukken, Deel 2, 1755, ff. 727-29.</p>
<p>There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, Januarij van Boegies, bondsman of the heirs of the late captain lieutenant of the military, Godfried Gerhard Schindelaar, 45 years old at a guess, who, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, confesses it to be true:</p>
<p>That coming home during the afternoon on Sunday, which was the 2<sup>nd</sup> of this month November, the confessant found his fellow slave, Clara van Macassar, with whom he has a relationship and with whom he has several children, together with the cook, named Augustus, on their own in the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-556">galderij</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-556"><span class="header">galderij</span>Not a ‘gallery,’ but usually a family room behind the public front rooms of a house where families ate together or where domestic chores were performed. In some earlier Cape houses it referred to a passageway or linking area between the front room and the kitchen area.</span></em>, of which the last named, upon sighting the confessant, walked into the back room to a cradle standing there and rocked the confessant’s child who was lying in it. Wherefore the confessant, driven by the jealousy of love, asked the said Clara, what this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-557">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-557"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em>, against whom he for a considerable time had conceived a certain jealousy, had to do with her, who answered to this: “Nothing at all”. The aforementioned Augustus, when hearing this, came from the back room and then fobade the confessant to speak to this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-558">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-558"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em>, whereupon the confessant, feeling provoked, went to the back yard with the intention to get there a piece of firewood with which to beat the said <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-559">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-559"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em> Clara, yet, becoming senseless and mindless because of anger, he got into his hand in the slave house a <em>parrang</em>, instead of a piece of firewood, with which the confessant proceeded to the front and, after locking the front door and pulling the key from it, went to the back room in which was the aforementioned Clara, as also the aforesaid Augustus and the youngest child of his late <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-560">juffrouw</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-560"><span class="header">juffrouw</span>Strictly speaking this contraction of <em>jonkvrouw</em> was the form of address for a noble lady (as with <em>jonker</em>, the contraction of <em>jonkheer</em>, ‘lord’), but at the Cape it was more generally used by settlers for women with some social status. Moreover, in the eighteenth century this was also the term slaves used to address their female owners, alongside <em>nonje</em>.</span></em>, which is when the confessant jumped after the said Clara who, together with the aforesaid Augustus, had already fled through the window to the outside of the house, and then, with the aforementioned <em>parrang</em>, gave her a cut or three, without being able to say where or whether he had hit her. And upon seeing this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-561">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-561"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em> bleeding, the confessant fled with the <em>parrang</em> to Table Mountain.<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-3" id="d0-translation-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> From here, on the second night, he, with the help of the drainpipe of the back flat-roofed house,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-4" id="d0-translation-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> in which a Chinese lives, first climbed onto that flat roof and then into the back yard of his owner’s, in order to obtain his oilskin coat, since he was wearing nothing but a shirt. Yet, as this was not successful, the confessant again progressed to the mountain, where he remained till the day before yesterday when, forced by hunger, he went during the evening to the garden of the widow of the late former burgher councillor, <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-562">sieur</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-562"><span class="header">sieur</span>The form <em>sieur</em> is derived from <em>sinjeur</em>, but it is uncertain whether the latter came into colonial Dutch from French <em>seigneur</em> or Creole Portuguese <em>sinjoor</em> (both from Latin, <em>senior</em>, ‘older’). The word was commonly used by slaves at the Cape to address European males, but it was also the official title for lower-ranking VOC officials.

<p>The confessant declares finally that he had not been of the intention to murder either the said <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-564">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-564"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour.
