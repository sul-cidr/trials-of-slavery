  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>Slaves were often caught up in the domestic disputes of their owners. Michiel Lourich<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> was clearly a violent man who both beat his wife and ordered his slave January to whip his female slave Diana, causing the latter’s death. The reasons for his abuse of Diana are not clear, but they may have been linked to his dispute with his wife, whom he had thrown out of the house<sup><a href="#summary-fn-2" id="summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. Fabricius, the Company soldier who was lodging at Lourich’s house,<sup><a href="#summary-fn-3" id="summary-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> was clearly shocked by his behaviour, towards both his wife and Diana, and left the household.</p>
<p>The fiscal did not recommend a sentence, but the court decided that Lourich should be banished from the Cape ‘as soon as possible’ and sent back to the Netherlands at his own cost ‘as a useless subject’.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-4" id="summary-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Included here are two testimonies, those of the lodger soldier Jan Fabricius, and that of one of Lourich’s slaves, Januarij, both of whom witnessed the events, as well as a report on the autopsy.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-5" id="summary-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Michiel Daniel Lourich was born in Germany and arrived at the Cape as soldier in 1727, served as loan <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-251">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-251"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> during 1730-31, and became a free burgher in 1734. In 1736 he obtained the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-252">pacht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-252"><span class="header">pacht</span>Literally ‘lease.’ The VOC at the Cape had a system whereby the right to retail certain profitable goods (mostly alcohol and meat) was sold regularly. A <em>pacht</em> was therefore in effect a monopoly.</span></em> to sell malt beer for a year (Hoge 1946: 248-49 and Leibbrandt 1906: 670). In this case it appears that by 1740 he was running some sort of public house, with his slave having to wait upon people who were drinking there. The place was also a lodging house, hence Fabricius’s presence. Running lodging houses was one of the main occupations of Cape burghers in the eighteenth century (Worden et al. 1998: 57). <a href="#summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>She was Anna Catharina Biesel, born at the Cape, the daughter of Christiaan Andries Biesel and Aletta de Nijs. She married Lourich on 14 October 1736 and their only child, Johannes Georg, was the four-month-old baby who features in this case. (Heese &#x26; Lombard 1986-2004, vol. 1: 278). Mentzel, the contemporary writer on the Cape who stayed here between 1733 and 1741, was a friend of Lourich and had this revealing, though euphemistic, passage on their marriage: ‘He [Lourich] was married but he could not get on with his wife. They were both excellent people but their dispositions would not harmonise.’ He glossed over the reason for Lourich’s departure from the Cape, which is revealed in this case, and merely continued: ‘So they separated, and the man obtained the Governor’s permission to leave the Cape and return to his native place’ (Mentzel 1919: 138). It was as an indirect result of this case that Mentzel accidentally left the Cape: In January 1741 he went on board <em>Hartenlust</em> in order to deliver some letters to the banished Lourich who was returning to Europe on this ship. Mentzel spent the night on board but only awoke when the ship was already sailing away from the Cape (ships usually waited for a favourable wind and, when it did arrive, left immediately) (Mentzel 1919: 136-45). <a href="#summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>Fabricius was not stationed at the Cape (he does not appear in the Cape muster rolls for 1739 or 1740) and it is therefore likely that he was on one of the ships that was then in Cape Town harbour (possibly the <em>Hartenlust</em> which had arrived two days earlier, Bruijn et al. 1979, vol. III: 354) and that he was lodging with Lourich. <a href="#summary-fnref-3" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

Although Lourich pleaded that ‘soo hij iets in deese gedaan heeft dat strafbaar is, dat hem sulx mag gepardoneert werden’ (if he had done anything in this matter that was punishable, that it should be forgiven), he was found guilty by the court of maltreating a slave and was sentenced on 1 December 1740 ‘omme … als een onnut subject van hier naar het vaderland verzonden te werden, met condemnatie in de costen’ (to be sent from here to the fatherland as a useless subject, with sentencing to the [court] costs), CJ 22, ff. 81-2. <a href="#summary-fnref-4" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

                <div class="astro-FK3CUU5Z"><p>Today, 11 October 1740, there appears before me, Daniel Godfried Carnspek, secretary of the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the soldier Jan Christoffel Fabricius, of competent age, who, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, <em>Meester</em> Daniel van den Henghel, declares it to be the whole truth:</p>
<p>That at seven o’clock in the morning of Saturday, the 8<sup>th</sup> of this current month October, the deponent saw sitting in the kitchen of the burgher Michiel Daniel Lorich [<em>sic</em>], with whom he was lodging at this time, the wife of said Lorich, for which reason, he asked her: “<em>Juffrouw</em>, why are you sitting here so early?”, to which she answered: “Lorich had locked the door of the room”. The deponent then went into his bedroom where he dressed himself, during which time the said burgher Lorich came from his room, whereupon the said wife of Lorich asked her husband, when they were both in the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-254">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-254"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch). In most houses this was a room, although in the later design of some Cape houses it referred to a narrower passage (like a hall or vestibule) flanked by one or more front rooms.</span></em>,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> if she might go out, to which the same answered her: “No, you will stay at home”, which is when she stood up from the chair on which she had sat down just a moment before, saying: “I am going out”. Upon this, the aforementioned Lorich gave his wife a kick with his foot on her behind, saying suddenly: “Get out of the house with your bastard child, you cow!”, whereafter this woman indeed left the house with her child on the arm.</p>
<p>That the deponent also went out, returning home in the evening at about six o’clock and found them sitting with abovementioned Lorich in the room, the boatswain of the ship’s yard [at the Cape], Laurens Staff,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-2" id="d0-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> who – as the deponent could hear – was doing his utmost to persuade Lorich, who was uttering several swearing words, to take back again into his house his aforementioned wife. Hearing this, the deponent went to the stoep where he walked up and down, and shortly hereafter the said boatswain, Laurens Staff, also came through the door and, after saying goodbye, went away. Whereupon the said Lorich came to the deponent, asking him if he would like to drink a glass of wine with him, to which the deponent answered yes; and together went into the room where each drank a glass of wine. That the deponent, with the aforementioned Lorich, first sat talking in the said room and then walked up and down in the house until after ten o’clock, during which time the said Lorich was continually swearing and cursing his wife; after which the deponent said to Lorich that, since it was already after ten, he would go to bed, whereupon the said Lorich left him and the deponent lay himself down to rest in the large room on the righthand side. However, having slept for only a short while, a certain <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-255">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-255"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em> belonging to Lorich, without him knowing her name, came into the room to the deponent and fell onto his body, crying: “Oh, <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-256">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-256"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’.

At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> named Januarij also came into the room and took the aforementioned <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-259">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-259"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour.

At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> and threw it into the large room, saying at once to Lorich: “You ought to be ashamed of yourself, what sort of life is this in this house, what would the neighbours think?”, to which the said Lorich answered: “That is none of your business, she is my slave, the thievish whore has earned it”, after which the deponent again went into his room, where he dressed himself, left the house and went to the house of the burgher Jochem Jurriens, at which point it had been about 12 o’clock at night.</p>

<p>There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the soldier Jan Christoffel Fabricius, who, after this, his given deposition, had been read out word by word, clearly and plainly, declares to fully persist by it, therefore not desiring that anything more be added to or taken from it, and consequently said, in the presence of the burgher Michiel Daniel Lourich, as confirmation of the truth, these solemn words: “Truly so, help me, Almighty God”.</p>

<p>Thus recorded at the office of the secretary of justice at the Castle of Good Hope, in the presence of the clerks Hendrik Emanuel Blanckenberg and Otto Camphuijsen, as witnesses, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the deponent and me, the secretary.</p>
<p>Verification</p>
<p>There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the slave Januarij van Mallabaar, who, after this, his given deposition, had been read out word by word, clearly and plainly, declares to fully persist by it, therefore not desiring that anything be added to or taken from it, declaring, in the presence of his said owner, all of the above to contain the whole truth.</p>
<p>Thus verified at the Cape of Good Hope on 18 November 1740 before the honourables A. Decker and Jacob de Hennion, members from the aforementioned honourable Council of Justice, who have properly signed the original of this, together with the deponent and me, the first clerk.</p>
<p>Which I declare, [signed] P.J. Slotsboo, first sworn clerk.</p>
<p><strong>CJ 345</strong> Criminele Process Stukken, 1740, ff. 594r-v.</p>
<p>On the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, <em>Meester</em> Daniel van den Henghel, we, the first and second chief surgeons of the honourable Company’s hospital, declare to have opened the head and inspected, in the presence of the delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the honourables Philip Rudolph de Savoij and Jacobus d’Hennion, a woman slave named Diana van Bengalen, belonging to the burgher Daniel Lorich, and to have found:</p>
<p>A wound above the left eye, another small one on top of the head, not going further than partly through the muscles and being caused by an external sharp instrument, and also wounds on numerous places over the whole body, with bruises on the skin, to outward appearances caused by <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-305">sjambok</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-305"><span class="header">sjambok</span>This word entered seventeenth-century Dutch via Malay (<em>tjambok</em>) or Javanese (<em>sambok</em>) from Persian (<em>châbuk</em>). It is a whip cut from thick animal skin, usually hippopotamus or rhinoceros, and was already known in the Dutch East Indies as an instrument for punishing slaves. At the Cape it was also used to beat draught animals with.</span></em> lashes, but which are not mortal wounds; also being unable to determine if death was caused by them, or rather by suddenly drinking [something] cold on a heated and wholly agitated body,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-3" id="d0-translation-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> or because of the cold, since the corpse was found totally naked on the first inspection.</p>
<p>As sign of the truth we have undersigned this with our customary signatures.</p>
