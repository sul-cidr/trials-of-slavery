  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>This case reveals the problems that slaves faced in forming permanent emotional and sexual relationships when they could be separated by sale at any time.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> Anthonij’s attempts to get back to the farm from which he had been sold were caused by his separation from Jannetie, the slave whom he refers to as his ‘wife’, although VOC law did not recognise the right of slaves to marry.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-2" id="summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> His discovery that she had taken another partner after his permanent and forced departure led to his attack on her and his subsequent attempted suicide – whether from despair at her infidelity, or from fear of punishment for his attack, is unclear.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the court imposed a milder sentence than the death penalty recommended in the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-95">eijsch</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-95"><span class="header">eijsch</span>Literally ‘claim’ or ‘demand.’ This is strictly speaking the <em>eijsch ende conclusie</em> without the final part about sentencing, but the term is often used as a shorthand for the whole document.</span></em>,<sup><a href="#summary-fn-3" id="summary-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> presumably having some sympathy for Anthonij’s predicament. Nonetheless, he was still whipped, branded, forced to work in chains and returned to his new owner. Given his attempted suicide, it is questionable which fate he might have preferred. Of Jannetjie we know no more.</p>
<p>Both the <em>sententie</em> and the interrogation of Anthonij van Goa are included in this case. Although there is much repetition, each document has its own character and insights. From the <em>sententie</em> we learn more details of the case as a whole, while the answers Anthonij gives to the questions of the court bring us closer to his own voice and motivations. It is a rare example of a slave’s direct testimony, albeit mediated through the scribe of the court.</p>

<p>Sales were relatively frequent, since the Dutch laws of inheritance, which often divided up estates amongst a large number of heirs, frequently led to the break-up of slaveholdings, and auctions of household goods (which included slaves) were regular occurrences. Sometimes slaves were bought by relatives, but they were still usually transferred to new locations and separated from the other slaves with whom they had lived, worked and formed relationships, Worden 1985: 49-50 and Shell 1994: 104-21. <a href="#summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>Slave marriage was not made legal until 1823. Only freed slaves were allowed to marry before then, Shell 1994: 320. Nonetheless, some slaves formed permanent partnerships which were often referred to by the authorities as ‘concubinage’.

<p>There appears before the undersigned deputised members from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the here-named slave Anthonij, who has answered to the questions below as is noted besides each one.</p>
<p>Article 1: The prisoner’s name, place of birth and age.</p>
<p>Answer: Anthonij van Goa, about thirty years old at a guess.</p>
<p>Article 2: Whose bondsman is the defendant currently?</p>
<p>Answer: Belonging to Beatrix Verweij, currently living in the Tijgerbergen.</p>
<p>Article 3: How long ago and by whom he was sold to the same?</p>
<p>Answer: That Oberholster, as his former <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-98">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-98"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’. In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em>, had sold him on his auction to the aforementioned Beatrix, without knowing the correct date.</p>
<p>Article 4: How long a time the defendant had served the same before he fled from her for the first time?</p>
<p>Answer: I believe two weeks, but I had a permission letter to go and fetch my things, which were being looked after by the slaves of Jan Jurgen Roos, and from there I went to the farm of Abraham Cloete, which he had bought from my previous <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-99">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-99"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’.

It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em>.</p>
<p>Article 5: When this was and what goods he took with him?</p>
<p>Answer: As answered to the aforegoing, and to have taken nothing but a blanket.</p>
<p>Article 6: Where he then went to?</p>
<p>Answer: The final time to have stayed at Abraham Cloete.</p>
<p>Article 7: How long he remained there and elsewhere?</p>
<p>Answer: That on that evening, after he had gone from the post<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> of his mistress, he slept a night on the post of his former master, the second night on the post of the aforementioned Abraham Cloete and the day thereafter the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-100">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-100"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> of his mistress came to get him from there.</p>
<p>Article 8: Who had provided him with necessities at that time?</p>
<p>Answer: That he was called by the slaves to the house of Oberholster and got food, and also in a similar manner at Cloete’s.</p>
<p>Article 9: Where, as well as by whom the prisoner, was captured?</p>
<p>Answer: By the aforementioned <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-101">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-101"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> of his mistress, on the aforementioned post of Abraham Cloete.</p>
<p>Article 10: If, when he arrived home, he received punishment?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 11: How long thereafter he again ran away from his mistress?</p>
<p>Answer: Eight days after this.</p>
<p>Article 12: Whence he proceeded to and stayed at?</p>
<p>Answer: Directly to the post of Oberholster, but neither he, nor his wife, saw me, and I stayed in a kloof above the farm of Oberholster, and at night I was with the bondsmen.</p>
<p>Article 13: If, at this time, he was not inter alia on the farm of his said <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-102">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-102"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’.

<p>Answer: Yes, but that Oberholster was at the Cape.</p>
<p>Article 14: Who provided the prisoner with food and in what way he maintained himself there?</p>
<p>Answer: To have been provided by the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-103">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-103"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em> and <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-104">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-104"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> and further to have maintained himself as it says in article 12.</p>
<p>Article 15: If at that time there was also a woman slave at that place, and (if so) how named?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, and is named Jannetie.</p>
<p>Article 16: To whom she belongs, as also if the prisoner had any acquaintance with the same?</p>
<p>Answer: Oberholster, and she was my own wife when I lived there.</p>
<p>Article 17: If he did not wound the same?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 18: In what way he performed this?</p>
<p>Answer: This <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-105">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-105"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour.

<p>Article 19: Why he had did this?</p>
<p>Answer: Because she had a relationship with another.</p>
<p>Article 20: If it was with the intention to kill her?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 21: If the knife now shown to him in court is the same knife with which he had committed the atrocious deed?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 22: Where and in what way the prisoner got rid of the same?</p>
<p>Answer: I ran to the thicket with it and when people came to catch me, I wounded myself and then threw the knife away.</p>
<p>Article 23: How the prisoner was apprehended and got into the hands of the <em>eijsscher</em>?</p>
<p>Answer: By Jan and Claas Louw, as well as Jacob Cloete and Jan van Ellewe, after which being handed over to the <em>eijsscher</em> by Jan Louw and Jacob Cloete.</p>
<p>Article 24: If he, the prisoner, had given any resistance to those who wanted to catch him?</p>
<p>Answer: No.</p>
<p>Article 25: In what way did this come to pass?</p>
<p>Answer: I did nothing.</p>
<p>Article 26: If he wounded himself at that time?</p>
<p>Answer: As in article 22.</p>
<p>Article 27: Why he had done this?</p>
<p>Answer: I thought that I could just as well kill myself, to escape the punishment.</p>
<p>Article 28: If it had been with the same knife with which he also afflicted the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-107">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-107"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em>?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 29: If the prisoner was of the intention to do more mischief there at that house?</p>
<p>Answer: No.</p>
<p>Article 30: If the prisoner realises that he deserves a heavy punishment for this crime?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Thus questioned and answered at the Cape of Good Hope on 7 March 1721.</p>

                <div class="astro-FK3CUU5Z"><p>Since Anthonij van Goa, 30 years old at a guess, bondsman of the burgher Beatrix Verweij, currently their honours’ prisoner, has voluntarily confessed, without torture or force of bonds, of irons, or even the least threat of suchlike, and since it has appeared evident and clear to the honourable Council of Justice of this government:</p>
<p>That the prisoner was sold by the burgher Jan Oberholster on his public auction to the aforementioned Beatrix Verweij and, having rendered his services there for a period of about two months, obtained (as he asserts) a permission letter<sup><a href="#d1-translation-fn-1" id="d1-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> from his said owner to collect his things, which were being taken care of by the slaves of the farmer Jan Jurgen Roos, from there, on which occasion he took along a blanket.</p>
<p>That the prisoner then set out from there to his former master’s post, sleeping a night at that place, after which he resorted to the farm of the farmer Abraham Cloete, both situated around Stellenbosch, where he likewise slept a night, and was provided with food by the slaves at that place, that on the third day after he had gone from his mistress, he was fetched by the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-108">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-108"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> of the same from this last post and brought back to the aforementioned farm of his mistress, where he was chastised over this staying away. However, the prisoner neither scrupled nor hesitated to run away from his mistress eight days after this and to betake himself to the farm of his former master, the aforementioned Jan Oberholster, where he stayed, during the following day, in a kloof in the mountains around there, and at night with the bondsmen of the aforementioned Oberholster, who also provided him with food, without Oberholster, who had ridden to the Cape, nor the same’s wife, having any knowledge of all these doings.</p>
<p>That the woman slave of the aforenamed Oberholster, named Jannetie – who was the prisoner’s concubine (as he asserts) when he too was living there as a slave, and who had promised him that she would not take another man for as long as he was alive – was also there at the house. When, however, he noticed that she, Jannetie, was lying with another <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-109">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-109"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em>, he pushed him away from her and, with the knife which was shown him in court, inflicted a wound in the abdomen of the aforementioned slave, Jannetie, underneath the stomach, about three fingers above the navel, penetrating internally to a depth of five fingers and externally three fingers in length, so that the omentum<sup><a href="#d1-translation-fn-2" id="d1-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> hung from the wound a quarter of the way and, moreover, that the inner membrane of the tissue was perforated;<sup><a href="#d1-translation-fn-3" id="d1-translation-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> confessing to have done this with the intention to take her life.</p>
<p>That the prisoner after having perpetrated this atrocious wounding, went with the same knife into the nearby thicket and, when people came to take him prisoner, he also wounded himself with that knife, with the intention to also rob himself of his life, in order to escape the public punishment of this monstrous deed in this way. That afterwards the prisoner, after having thrown the knife from him, was taken by the farmers Jan and Claas Louw, as well as Jacob Cloete and Jan van Ellewe, and finally delivered into the hands of justice by the aforementioned Cloete and Jan Louw.</p>
<p>All of which are matters of very great and pernicious consequences which, in a country where justice is practised, may not be tolerated under any circumstances, but must be restrained as an example and a deterrent to other such malicious creatures, and be punished severely.</p>
<p>Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, serving today, having seen and read the written <em>crimineelen eijsch en conclusie</em>, drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoner by the honourable landdrost Jacob Voet, in his official capacity, as well as having noted the prisoner’s own voluntary confession, properly verified in court, which was produced with the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-110">eijsch</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-110"><span class="header">eijsch</span>Literally ‘claim’ or ‘demand.’ This is strictly speaking the <em>eijsch ende conclusie</em> without the final part about sentencing, but the term is often used as a shorthand for the whole document.</span></em> in order to justify it; further having pondered everything which possibly served the case and could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the free United Netherlands, and having judged the prisoner, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the place where criminal sentences are usually executed here and there, having been handed over to the executioner, to be exposed with a rope around his neck under the gallows, then to be tied to a stake, to be severely scourged with rods on the bare back, thereupon to be branded, besides being riveted in chains for a period of two years, to be sent home to his mistress, provided the same pays the costs and expenditure of justice.</p>
<p>Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 27 March 1721.</p>
<p>Pronounced and executed on the 29<sup>th</sup> thereupon.</p>
