  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>This is a case of two Cape Town slaves who stole guns and ammunition from their owners and ran away.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> They survived in the False Bay area with the aid of a slave shepherd who brought them food. They were seen by a Company soldier, who was subdued by their brandishing their guns at him, but were eventually caught when one of them decided to sell his coat for food in Cape Town, while the other was apprehended by the Company slaves of the False Bay outpost at Simon’s Bay. The case again demonstrates the difficulties of survival for runaway slaves in the (relatively) settled regions of the colony and graphically illustrates the obsessive fear Cape society had of armed and uncontrolled slaves.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-2" id="summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>

<p>That about three months ago now, when the prisoners agreed with each other to desert from their masters, the second prisoner stole from his owner a crooked sabre from the attic and, at about nine o’clock at night, went with it to the house of the first prisoner’s owner, Jan Brouwer, where he joined the first prisoner in the kitchen, where the second prisoner remained until Brouwer and his <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-568">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-568"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> went to sleep, which is when the first prisoner stole from the room in which his <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-569">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-569"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’. In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em> and the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-570">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-570"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> were lying asleep and of which the door stood open, a musket, two pistols, and five shot cartridges, and likewise from the kitchen a cartridge case; with which the prisoners, after they each had first loaded a pistol with loose gunpowder, undertook their flight during the night; the first prisoner carrying the musket, one pistol and the cartridge case, and the second prisoner the other pistol and the broadsword, marching thus through the night, reaching Baas Harmens Craal<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-2" id="d0-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> by daylight and, during the following night, arrived at Baaij Fals.<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-3" id="d0-translation-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> At which place they stayed for about a month in the mountains, sustaining themselves, according to them, with food which the shepherd of the burgher Hendrik Feerssen, named April, and who was known to the first prisoner, would occasionally give them from his knapsack, and who also later, after they had chopped a bullet of one of the spent cartridges they had with them into four parts, loaded the musket with it, discharged it, while each of the prisoners was likewise loading a pistol with cartridges, and then loaded it once more.</p>
<p>That after some time, on a certain evening at nightfall, in fact at the beginning of the past month October, when the prisoners were on the slopes of the mountain, they were discovered by the soldier assigned to Baaij Fals, Barent Janssen,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-4" id="d0-translation-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> who was looking for horses, and who, thinking that they were the slaves of the burgher Jan Munnick, called out to them when he got within about five or six paces of them, and asked them if they had seen any horses; at which they suddenly turned around, and simultaneously each taking from his side a pistol, and at once, with stretched-out arms and cocked triggers, aimed these pistols at Janssen, while saying to him: “No, we have not seen any horses”. And so Barend Janssen, because of this unexpected and dangerous display, and because he was not equipped with any gun and, moreover, noticed that one of the prisoners had a musket as well, and the other one also something else on his shoulder, which he could not see properly because of the darkness, got very frightened. He then said to the prisoners: “<em>Paaij</em>,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-5" id="d0-translation-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup> do not harm me, I am not looking for you, because I have lost horses”, to which the prisoners then, after having told Janssen: “If you are looking for horses, it is fine, don’t come closer, but go backwards and let us not see you going to the Baaij” and, after having exchanged some words among themselves which Janssen did not understand; they dropped to their sides the pistols aimed at him. Upon this Janssen went backwards a couple of paces from them; however, when the prisoners, who were continuing on their way to the Baaij, were out of sight, he too set out to Baaij Fals where he gave a report of this to the postholder, while the prisoners were meanwhile also on their way to Baaij Fals.</p>
<p>That later, after about four days, the first prisoner, since he thought it fit to set out to the Cape in order to sell his <em>duffeltje</em><sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-6" id="d0-translation-fnref-6" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup> and bring back food for it, handed over to the second prisoner the musket, one pistol and the cartridge case and went to the Cape. However, along the way he repented and did not return again, but proceeded to his owner, by whom he was delivered into the hands of justice.</p>
<p>That on Saturday the 8<sup>th</sup> of the past month November, the shepherd of the aforesaid Feerssen, named April, came to the foot of the mountains and found the second prisoner asleep there with a pistol in his left arm, and also under the stones in a hole next to him, a musket, a pistol, a ramrod and a cartridge case, which April, thinking that he was a deserter, silently took it all away, which the second prisoner, who had woken up in the meantime, also allowed, on condition that he would give him some food as he was very hungry. April then told the second prisoner that he did not have any food with him, but that he should come in the evening to his master’s house in Baaij Fals, that he would then give him something to eat. Upon this, the second prisoner, armed with the one pistol, appeared there that very same evening, which is when April also gave him something in the kitchen. Yet, shortly hereafter, two slaves of the postholder of the Baaij came there, because of the warning given by the said April, and the second prisoner was captured by them and with the help of the aforementioned April, and thus also came into the hands of justice.</p>
<p>And since such a highly perilous escape and perpetrated public violence cannot be, nor should be, tolerated in a country where justice is practised but, on the contrary, must be punished most rigorously as an example and deterrent to other similarly inclined malefactors.</p>
<p>Thus it is, that the honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, serving today, having read and considered with attention the written <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-571">crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-571"><span class="header">crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie</span>Literally ‘criminal demand and conclusion.’ The document drawn up by the prosecutor based on the evidence he collected and delivered in court against an accused.

<p>An interesting word whose origins are disputed.

Scholtz, however, argues that at least <em>paai</em> is not a loan from Portuguese, claiming it ultimately derived from Dutch (Scholtz 1965: 183-84 and, for further examples from contemporary Cape texts, Scholtz 1972: 153). <a href="#d0-translation-fnref-5" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>
