  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>In two separate, but remarkably similar, cases in 1729, Stellenbosch burghers were each found guilty of causing the death of one of their slaves by excessive punishment. Here we print the records from one of them.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> Jan Botma confessed to ordering the beating of his slave Joseph van Malabaar (the job was performed by other slaves), but the precise cause of Joseph’s death remained unclear. Much was made of the fact that he drank rain water from the ground after his beating – over-consumption of water when the body was heated after a beating was believed to be a cause of illness and possibly death.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-2" id="summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> The surgeon reported that none of the wounds on Joseph’s body were ‘mortal’ and his verdict was death by drowning. The court nonetheless found Botma guilty of causing the death of his slave by excessive whipping, although he stated that he was not aware he had done any wrong. Unlike Jan de Thuilot, who was sentenced to death in 1708 for killing a slave (see case above), Botma was fined 100 rixdollars and ordered to pay costs.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-3" id="summary-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> That he was not let off completely shows that the Company regarded maltreatment of slaves leading to death as a punishable offence.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-4" id="summary-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The other burgher was Jan Steenkamp, who claimed that he had only allowed his slave Hector to be whipped for ‘niet langer als een pijp tobacq rookens’ (no longer than it takes to smoke a pipe of tobacco). He was fined 50 rixdollars, CJ 11, ff. 49-50.

The immediate cause of this was a horrific case of sadistic abuse of a slave by his owner, Christiaan Gottlieb Opperman (Shell 1994: 208), but clearly the authorities also had cases like that of Jan Botma in mind.

<p>There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the burgher Jan Botma, who has answered to the questions below in such a way as is written next to each one.</p>
<p>Article 1: What is the prisoner’s, name, place of birth, and age?</p>
<p>Answer: Jan Botma, born at the Cape of Good Hope, 27 years old.</p>
<p>Article 2: Working as what here, and where resident?</p>
<p>Answer: As a farmer, and to live at Stellenbosch.</p>
<p>Article 3: If the prisoner, on the 8<sup>th</sup> of the past month June, had a certain slave, named Joseph, be undressed, tied up and then beaten?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 4: For what reason the prisoner had this done?</p>
<p>Answer: Because this slave had torn the clothes from the body of a woman slave belonging to the prisoner and committed lots of violence, besides kicking and beating this woman slave.</p>
<p>Article 5: Where and by whom the prisoner had the said slave Joseph whipped, as also with what?</p>
<p>Answer: I had him tied onto a ladder and whipped thus with split canes.</p>
<p>Article 6: If this had been done at the prisoner’s farm, which is where he resides, and by his slaves Aaron and Domingo?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 7: And also if this was performed with split canes on the prisoner’s order?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 8: If the prisoner is also aware that the said slave Joseph had drunk water?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, this slave drank water after he was whipped, and even to such an extent that the prisoner’s slaves, Aaron and Domingo, had to carry him away from the water hole.</p>
<p>Article 9: From what, and when, the said slave Joseph came to die?</p>
<p>Answer: I do not know from what the slave died, but he was found dead in the morning of the day after he had been whipped.</p>
<p>Article 10: If the prisoner must not admit that he is highly punishable because of the actions he committed?</p>
<p>Answer: I do not know to have offended by it, and if I had known to do wrong by it, I would not have done it. Also, had I not been unwell, I would have brought this slave to Stellenbosch that very same evening.</p>
<p>Thus questioned and answered in the Castle of Good Hope on 28 July 1729.</p>

<p>Statement given by Domingo van Goa, bondsman of the farmer Jan Botma, on the requisition of the landdrost Pieter Lourensz, namely:</p>
<p>That when the testifier came home around evening on the 8<sup>th</sup> of this current month June, his master, the aforementioned Jan Botma, ordered him to help whip with split canes a certain fellow slave, named Joseph van Malabaar (who was naked and bound to a ladder, and already being beaten by his master’s slave, Aaron).</p>
<p>That the testifier having done this for about half an hour, with breaks in-between, together with the aforementioned Aaron, untied the said slave Joseph on the order of his master. Which is when the same [Joseph] went to the kitchen, where he sat for a while, after which he went outside through the door and, up to two times, drank there from a pool of rain water.</p>
<p>That the testifier then saw the aforementioned slave Aaron taking the said Joseph away from the water and bringing him to his bed, where the same also came to die that night.</p>
<p>Thus done and related in the Dutch language, which the testifier understands and speaks very well, at Stellenbosch on 11 June 1729.</p>

<p><strong>CJ 333</strong> Criminele Process Stukken, 1729, ff. 272r-v.</p>
<p>Statement given by Aaron van Madagascar, bondsman of the farmer Jan Botma, on the requisition of the landdrost Pieter Lourensz, namely:</p>
<p>That the testifier’s master, the aforementioned Jan Botma, had ordered him on Wednesday, the 8<sup>th</sup> of this current month June, to remove the clothes of his fellow slave, named Joseph van Malabaar, next, to tie him onto a ladder, and to whip him thus on the bare back with split canes.</p>
<p>That when the testifier had been busy whipping for some time, his fellow slave, named Domingo, was likewise commanded by his master to whip the aforementioned slave Joseph with rods.</p>
<p>That the testifier with the aforesaid Domingo, after having beaten the aforementioned slave Joseph for about one hour, with some breaks in-between, untied the same on the order of his master. Which is when the aforementioned slave Joseph went into the kitchen and, after having sat there for a while, went outside through the door and drank there, up to two times, from a pool of rain water.</p>
<p>That the testifier, finding the aforementioned slave Joseph lying by the pool, picked him up and lay him down on his bed, which is where he also came to die that night.</p>
<p>Thus done and related in the Dutch language, which the testifier understands and speaks very well, at Stellenbosch on 11 June 1729.</p>

<p><strong>CJ 333</strong> Criminele Process Stukken, 1729, f. 274</p>
<p>I, the undersigned surgeon of Drakenstein, attest, on the requisition of the landdrost Pieter Lourensz, to have examined, on the 10<sup>th</sup> of this current month June and in the presence of the deputised <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-147">heemraden</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-147"><span class="header">heemraden</span>The origin of this word is uncertain, but is connected to the Dutch words <em>heem</em> (‘homestead’) and <em>raad</em> (‘councillor’). This was the title of a free burgher who served on the <em>Collegie van Heemraden</em> in the rural districts of the Cape, usually for a term of two years.</span></em>, on the farm of Jan Botma a certain dead slave, named Joseph, belonging to the aforesaid Botma, and to have found that the same was whipped, although unable to find any mortal wounds on the same, but presumes that this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-148">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-148"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> Joseph must have drowned in the water, seeing that, when he had turned the same over, water ran from his mouth.</p>
