<p>That during the forenoon on Sunday of the previous week, when her mistress had ordered the slave Jephta van Madagascar to go and collect some cabbages on the farm of the former <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-787">heemraad</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-787"><span class="header">heemraad</span>The origin of this word is uncertain, but is connected to the Dutch words <em>heem</em> (‘homestead’) and <em>raad</em> (‘councillor’). This was the title of a free burgher who served on the <em>Collegie van Heemraden</em> in the rural districts of the Cape, usually for a term of two years.</span></em>, <em>Monsieur</em> Jacobus Conterman, the same said, while turning around and leaving the kitchen: “Your <em>moer</em>,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> can’t another <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-788">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-788"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> go to collect the cabbages!

That the said Jephta then departed and again got home at midday with some cabbage in a bag; that in the afternoon the testifier’s mistress herself prepared a pot full of cabbage and handed it over to the testifier to cook and, after having been occupied with this, she went outside to fetch water and, when the testifier came back into the kitchen, she saw the aforesaid Jephta (who in the meantime had come into the house) holding the lid of the pot in his hands and instantly setting it back, and when she asked him what he was doing there by the pot, he answered that the pot of cabbage was boiling rapidly and that he therefore took care of it, after which he again went outside. That thereupon the testifier, while stirring the aforementioned stewing cabbage, saw the head of a snake in the pot, which she immediately made known to her mistress; whereupon her owner and his wife, after they too had looked at this snake-head in the pot, took the said pot with everything that was in it from the kitchen and stowed it away. That the following morning, when Jephta was interrogated by their owner about this in her presence and the testifier reproached him for the above, the same said that he did not place the snake-head in the pot, notwithstanding the testifier’s testimony that on that afternoon nobody but the aforementioned slave Jephta had been in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable landdrost, Marthinus Adrianus Bergh, by the burgher Pieter de Villiers Abramsz, of competent age, which is of the following content, namely:</p>
<p>That during the afternoon of Sunday, the 29<sup>th</sup> of the just passed month October, when his wife had prepared a pot of cabbage for the evening meal and had let the same be hung over the fire to cook by his slave Carolina van Madagascar, a short while thereafter, at sunset, the said slave came to her mistress and said that, after she had left the kitchen to the outside to fetch water and again came in, she saw that the slave Jephta van Madagascar (who in the meantime had gone in there) had the lid of the aforementioned pot in his hands and then instantly set it on the pot again, whereupon Carolina asked him what he was doing there, and received as answer that he thought that the pot would boil over and therefore lifted the lid, after which he again went outside. That next Carolina, while stirring this food, found the head of a snake in the pot.</p>
<p>Upon which his wife investigated this and informed him thereof, whereupon he took the aforementioned pot from the fire and found in it the head of a snake with a small part [of its body]. That the testifier had the pot with its contents stowed away, without revealing anything of it to the said Jephta that evening, until the following morning when Jephta returned from his work and on his own initiative said to the testifier: “<em>Baas</em>, the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-789">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-789"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em> makes it so, is it right that she does so!”, whereupon the testifier tied him up, took him to the aforementioned pot, and asked him if he did not place the aforementioned poison in it himself. This was denied by him, while he again answered little to what the aforementioned Carolina said (who related the above to the testifier in his presence), saying only that he did not do it. Which is why the testifier brought the aforementioned slave Jephta here under arrest for further investigation of this case.</p>
<p>There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing, if so required, to subsequently confirm the above with solemn oaths.</p>
<p>Thus related at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch on 6 November 1775 in the presence of the messenger of the court Morits Herman Otto Woeke and the beadle Johannes Jacobus Reiniers, requested as witnesses hereto.</p>

Waarop den relatant hem voorts gebonden en bij voormelde pot gebragt, mitsgaders gevraagd had of hij ’t voormelde vergif selfs niet daarin gedaan had, wierd sulx door hem ontkend terwijl denselven wijders op ’t gesegde van voormelde Carolina (dewelke het vorenstaande ter zijner presentie aan den relatant quam te verhalen) wijnig had g’antwoord, zeggende alleenlijk dat hij ’t niet gedaan had.
