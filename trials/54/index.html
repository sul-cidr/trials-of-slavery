  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>This is an unusual and insightful case for a number of reasons.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> It concerns complaints by the labourers on a remote Roggeveld farm that their mistress, Christina Strang, had killed a slave. They only had the opportunity to do this when they accompanied their master, Jacobus Kruger, to Cape Town two years after the event. Strang was summonsed but denied the accusation, instead producing her own rather improbable version of what had happened. The Council of Justice fined her 50 rixdollars and ordered that Januarij van Ceijlon, the slave who had brought the complaint, be sold, with the stipulation that he should never again come into her possession or that of her children.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-2" id="summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The case shows how the owners of a frontier farm, male and female, could act with impunity, both by killing a slave and by intimidating the others to keep quiet about the fact for several years. It includes other features of interest. The murdered slave was a newcomer from the East Indies and the evidence includes details of the problems he faced in adapting, including unfamiliarity with the work, language and dress, and the way in which he was viewed ethnically by the other slaves and their owners. One of the testimonies was by a young Khoi boy who would have been seven or eight years old at the time these events took place. It is noteworthy that two of the slaves and all of the adult Khoi had run away from the farm by the time the complaint could be brought to the authorities. Clearly, this was not a popular place in which to live and work.</p>

At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> as he was yellow in colour<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-3" id="d0-translation-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> – had to labour, with the help of some Hottentots, on the building of a stone corral, the stones for which they had to search for in the vicinity and had to drag them there with oxen, while the aforesaid Augustus moreover also had to lead these draught oxen.</p>
<p>That as the aforesaid Augustus did not labour to the satisfaction of their mistress, who had remained at home, she came to them at about eleven o’clock in the morning of a certain day, without being able to say which, with a <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-667">kirrij</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-667"><span class="header">kirrij</span>This is the Cape Khoi word for the walking stick traditional Khoikhoi carried with them and used as weapons.

The testifier, who was only standing about ten or twelve paces from there, then saw his aforementioned mistress beating the said Augustus everywhere, except on his head, with the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-668">kirrij</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-668"><span class="header">kirrij</span>This is the Cape Khoi word for the walking stick traditional Khoikhoi carried with them and used as weapons.

<p>That the aforesaid Augustus, because of the pain from the blows he received, was not able to pick up heavy stones and, on top of that, the work was in any case difficult for him, consequently, whenever he saw his mistress coming towards them, he always carried small stones. When this was perceived by the testifier’s mistress, she again, after fully an hour or somewhat more had passed, again beat the same with the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-669">kirrij</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-669"><span class="header">kirrij</span>This is the Cape Khoi word for the walking stick traditional Khoikhoi carried with them and used as weapons.

<p>That the aforementioned Augustus was unable to work, but was not beaten any longer by the testifier’s mistress, although he remained with the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-675">volk</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-675"><span class="header">volk</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used to refer either to a group of people in the sense of ‘nation,’ or more commonly a group of people acting or working together. It was thus often used as a short-hand term for common labourers. Although the word was used in this latter meaning at the Cape to refer to European labourers, it eventually – due to the racial divide in the labour situation – came to refer to both slaves and Khoikhoi in the sense of manual labourers. This usage lived on in modern Afrikaans <em>plaasvolk</em>, ‘farm labourers.’</span></em> working there until they had finished their labour, which is when the same, as best he could, went to the slave house, without the testifier knowing whether or not the said Augustus thereafter or during the late afternoon had gone to fetch water since, as the testifier was doing his work, he did not take note of that; as also whether or not, in so far as the testifier is aware or able to remember, there had been any stranger on the farm that afternoon or had remained there that night, since the testifier, as soon as he had come from his work, went to the slave house, from where one is only able to see the house of his owner from the back.</p>
<p>That when the testifier woke up at about midnight, he went to the fire place inside the slave house in order to start a fire as it was cold, which is when he found the slave Augustus, who had been lying next to it, lying dead, which the testifier reported, early in the morning, to the little children of the house since his mistress was still asleep.</p>
<p>That when the the testifier had finished the milking that morning, his mistress came into the slave house, looked at the dead slave and ordered the testifier and a grown Hottentot living there, by the name of Boegies, to just go and bury the aforesaid Augustus, which they also did. The testifier says that this Hottentot has since run away from there.</p>
<p>That two or three days thereafter, when a slave <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-676">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-676"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>Statement given, on the requisition of the landdrost of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, <em>Sieur</em> Johannes Jacobus le Sueur, by the Hottentot Jantje, 10 or 11 years old at a guess, going as follows:</p>
<p>That the testifier lives with the farmer Jacobus Kruger on his farm situated in the Roggen Veld and that a long time ago now, without being able to specify this, when the aforesaid Kruger had set out to Stellenbosch to drill, and when the slaves January and Augustus, together with some grown Hottentots, who have since all run away from there, and the testifier with another little Hottentot named Danster were busy, on the order of the wife of the aforesaid Kruger, to collect stones and to drag them with oxen in order to build a corral with them, he saw the aforesaid wife beat the slave Augustus, because he did not labour to her satisfaction, with a <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-683">kirrij</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-683"><span class="header">kirrij</span>This is the Cape Khoi word for the walking stick traditional Khoikhoi carried with them and used as weapons.

<p>That this slave was then able to do even less, and because of this was beaten a second time by the said wife, and, amongst other places, also on his head, so much so that it bled heavily and that the aforementioned Augustus came to fall down on the ground, and after having lain there for some time, again got up from the ground and started anew with his work. However, since he could not perform it, he said to his mistress, who was sitting not far from there, that he could not work, which is when she had the hands of this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-684">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-684"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

After some time, the testifier then saw this slave untied again, without being able to say exactly how he might have become free.</p>
<p>That the aforesaid Augustus then remained at work and also worked a bit with them, and afterwards, by evening, went to the slave house; not knowing if the same had gone into the house of his owner to fetch water, but he does know that the same Augustus passed away that night in the slave house. The testifier also declares that the aforesaid Augustus had always been rather sickly, or that he was suffering from swollen legs, and also: that on the very same night when Augustus died, there had been at the farm of his owner a strange man, being tall of person<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-6" id="d0-translation-fnref-6" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup> and having arrived by horse, who stayed over that night and departed again early in the following morning.</p>

<p>Statement given, on the requisition of the landdrost of Stellenbosch and Drakensteijn, <em>Sieur</em> Jacobus Johannes le Sueur, by Christina Strang, wife of the farmer Jacobus Cruger junior, of competent age, going as follows:</p>
<p>That already two years ago this past October, without knowing the day or date, when the testifier’s husband had set out to Stellenbosch to attend the burgher drill and she found herself alone at home with his children on their farm named the Tondeldoos Fonteijn, situated in the Rogge Veld, she employed, during her husband’s absence, his two slave <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-688">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-688"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> Augustus and Januarij, as well as the little Hottentots Jantje and Danser, to drag along stones on a cattle skin, in front of which some oxen were spanned in, in order to build corrals with them.</p>
<p>That on a certain day, which the testifier is unable to name, it came to her knowledge that the aforesaid slave <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-689">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-689"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> Augustus, who had to lead the oxen, was becoming very lax in his work that morning, for which reason the testifier went to him and gave him one or two blows on his hands with a little piece or splinter of a stick, while saying: “Why do you not hold that rope properly and lead nicely?” After which she again went from there; saying that the aforementioned slave Augustus was still very <em>baar</em><sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-7" id="d0-translation-fnref-7" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup> and unskilled, and also being unable to speak a word of Portuguese but only Malay.<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-8" id="d0-translation-fnref-8" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Further – without knowing whether or not it had been on the same day that the testifier had given the aforementioned Augustus the aforesaid two blows – when, in the late morning, the little Hottentot Jantje called out from the yard to the testifier sitting inside the house: “<em>Nonje</em>, look, Augustus does not want to lead!”, the testifier got up and went there, whereupon the aforesaid Augustus, as soon as she came close, took up a stone from the ground and, by lifting up his arm, made a sign as if he wanted to throw it at the testifier; nevertheless, he did not throw it, but dropped the said stone onto the ground as soon as the testifier had ordered the other slave <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-690">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-690"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em>, Januarij, to take an oxen <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-691">riem</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-691"><span class="header">riem</span>A thin strip of leather. It was commonly used at the Cape due to the expense and a shortage of ropes.</span></em> and to give the aforesaid Augustus a beating with it. However, the testifier is unable to say positively whether or not this slave, who was laid down on the ground, was tied up, but can say that he lay on the ground and received, on her order, six or seven lashes with the oxen <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-692">riem</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-692"><span class="header">riem</span>A thin strip of leather. It was commonly used at the Cape due to the expense and a shortage of ropes.</span></em> from the slave Januarij, without though being able to know the number of lashes he received as she did not count them. After this, the aforementioned Augustus continued to perform his work that day, after first, however, filling a pipe with tobacco in the slave house and by pointing to the pipe and saying to one of the testifier’s children in Malay: “Little <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-693">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-693"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’. In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em>, go and fetch fire”, obtained the same, and then smoked the aforesaid pipe in the slave house.</p>
<p>That when the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-694">volk</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-694"><span class="header">volk</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used to refer either to a group of people in the sense of ‘nation,’ or more commonly a group of people acting or working together. It was thus often used as a short-hand term for common labourers. Although the word was used in this latter meaning at the Cape to refer to European labourers, it eventually – due to the racial divide in the labour situation – came to refer to both slaves and Khoikhoi in the sense of manual labourers. This usage lived on in modern Afrikaans <em>plaasvolk</em>, ‘farm labourers.’</span></em> stopped working at midday and when they, as well as the aforementioned <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-695">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-695"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>That when this slave Augustus had been lying there for about an hour, he got up from the ground of his own accord, and again went to work with the other slave and the Hottentots, and continued with it until the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-699">volk</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-699"><span class="header">volk</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used to refer either to a group of people in the sense of ‘nation,’ or more commonly a group of people acting or working together.

That afternoon, the aforementioned Augustus had been at least three times in the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-700">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-700"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch). In most houses this was a room, although in the later design of some Cape houses it referred to a narrower passage (like a hall or vestibule) flanked by one or more front rooms.</span></em> and was seen by the farmer Jan Gijsbert Olivier, who had just arrived there and slept there that night. Further, the said Augustus ate that evening with the other <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-701">volk</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-701"><span class="header">volk</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used to refer either to a group of people in the sense of ‘nation,’ or more commonly a group of people acting or working together.

This usage lived on in modern Afrikaans <em>plaasvolk</em>, ‘farm labourers.’</span></em> in one and the same little hut and went to sleep. The following morning, when the the testifier was still asleep, a little Hottentot by the name of Jantje knocked on the door up to two times, when he called to the testifier: “<em>Nonje</em>, Augustus is dead!”, to which she answered: “Oh, go away, Hottentot!”, whereupon the said Jantje continued: “Yes! Certainly, <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-702">nonje</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-702"><span class="header">nonje</span>This word entered Dutch from Malay <em>nyonya</em> (which in turn derived from Portuguese <em>dona</em>, ‘lady’) and was in use at the Cape since its foundation. It was used both by settlers to refer to women in general, and by slaves and Khoikhoi as a form of address for female Europeans. It survived in modern Afrikaans in the form of <em>nooi</em> or <em>nôi</em>, ‘young (unmarried) woman’, although it is now somewhat archaic.</span></em>!”, for which reason the testifier got up, went to the slave house and found the aforementioned Augustus lying naked, except for his trousers, and dead, after which the testifier had a grave dug by the slave <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-703">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-703"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

As the testifier returned from the slave house that morning, the aforesaid Olivier met her in the door of her house, yet she does not know whether or not he had gone to the slave house, but she does know that she did not speak with this man over the death of the aforesaid Augustus, as the said Olivier also shortly thereafter departed and, also, that a Hottentot by the name of Frederik, who was then still with her, had shown this man the way. She had had the aforementioned Augustus buried without informing any of the neighbours, nor having had the corpse inspected, nor had she herself given a report of it to the petitioner, or had it done by anybody else.</p>
<p>The testifier finally declares that she did not hear from the slave <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-705">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-705"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>In the Dutch East Indies it was customary to refer to a newly-arrived person from Europe as <em>orang baru</em> (literally ‘new person’), while somebody who had been to the East Indies before was called an <em>orang lama</em> (‘long ago person’). From these Malay terms developed the use of the adjectives <em>baar(s)</em>, ‘raw, inexperienced’, and <em>oorlam(s)</em>, ‘practised, skilled, shrewd’ in Dutch. These words were used especially to describe sailors, but at the Cape eventually also came to be used for slaves (see Boshoff &#x26; Nienaber 1967: 147 and 466, and, for further examples, Scholtz 1972: 112-13 and 151). <a href="#d0-translation-fnref-7" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>If, as stated, Augustus came from Batavia, he would have been used to Malay as a lingua franca, but it is interesting that the implication here is that he would eventually have picked up Portuguese at the Cape. On the use of Malay and Creole Portuguese as contact languages at the Cape and in the East Indies, see 1775 Moses van Bengalen. <a href="#d0-translation-fnref-8" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<li id="d0-translation-fn-9">
<p>While there is copious evidence for the use of Creole Portuguese and Malay amongst slaves at the Cape during this period (see 1775 Moses van Bengalen), the extent to which these languages were known and used by colonists in their dealings with slaves is considerably less certain. In many cases, colonists clearly did not understand their slaves when they used these languages (for example, 1757 Baatjoe van Mandhaar). But this case gives intriguing examples of a colonist woman and her children being familiar with at least some rudimentary form of the languages, and raises the question if they picked it up during their interactions with the slaves. For a detailed discussion of this issue, see Franken 1953: 41-79, especially pp. 71-2 which specifically deal with this case. <a href="#d0-translation-fnref-9" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>Dat wanneer, in de jongstleeden maand October reets twee jaaren voorleeden, sonder den dag off datum te weeten, der relatante man, om de burger exercitie aan Stellenbosch bij te woonen, sig derwaards begeeven had, en de relatante sig met derselver kinderen alleen te huijs was bevindende op haar plaats, genaamt de Tondeldoos Fonteijn, geleegen op ’t Rogge Veld, de relatante geduurende de absentie van haaren man derselver twee slaven jongens August en Januarij, beneevens de kleijne Hottentotten Jantje en Danser [<em>sic</em>], had te werk gesteld om op een beesten vel, waar voor eenige ossen bespannen waaren, klippen aan te sleepen, ten eijnde daarvan kraalen op te maaken.</p>
<p>Dat wanneer op een seekeren dag, die de relatante egter niet weet te noemen, aan haar ter kennis was gekoomen dat voorseijde slavenjongen August, die de ossen leijden moeste, op een morgen in sijn werk seer langsaam quam te sijn, den relatante haar oversulx na denselven begeeven, en hem met een stukje of spaan van een stok een á twee slagen op sijne handen toegevoegd had, onder het seggen: Waarom houd gij dat touw niet ter deegen vast en leijd mooij? Waarna sij weederom van daar weggegaan was, seggende dat meergemelde slaaff August, nog seer baars en onbedreven geweest was, ook geen woord Portugees, maar slegs Maleijds had spreeken kunnen.</p>
<p>Dat vermits vervolgens, sonder te weeten of het op dieselven dag geweest is als de relatante meergemelde August de voorseijde twee slagen toegebragt heeft ofte niet, den kleijnen Hottentot Jantje de relatante, die toenmaals in huijs geseeten had, in den voordemiddag van de werff af had toegeroepen: Nonje, kijk, August wil niet leijden!, had de relatante opstaande, sig derwaards begeeven, hebbende voorseijde August, soodra de relatante denselven genadert hadde, eene klip van de grond opgenoomen, en daarmeede, door het opligten van zijn arm, een bewijs gedaan alsof hij na de relatante gooijen wilde, hebbende denselven eevenwel niet geworpen, maar gemelde klip, soo als de relatante tot den anderen slave jongen Januarij had gesegt, en denselven gelast, dat hij een ossen riem neemen en voorseijde August daarmeede eene loesing geeven soude, weederom op de grond laaten vallen, kunnende de relatante nogthans niet positief seggen of dien slaaf, dewelke op de grond needergelegt is, vastgebonden is geworden ofte niet, maar wel dat hij op de aarde leggende, van den slaaf Januarij, ter haarer ordre, met den ossen riem, ses á seeven slagen ontfangen heeft, sonder hetselve getal der bekoomene slagen egter te weeten alsoo sij relatante die niet getelt had, waarna voormelde August, sijn werk dien dag was blijven waarneemen, naar egter alvoorens een pijp tobak in ’t slavenhuijs gestopt, daartoe van een der relatante kinderen, onder ’t wijsen op de pijp en ’t seggen in ’t Maleijdsche [<em>sic</em>]: Baasje, loop haal vuur, ’tselve bekoomen, en de voorseijde pijp in ’t slavenhuijs uijtgerookt te hebben.</p>
<p>Dat wanneer het volk op den middag van ’t werk uijtgescheijden was, en soo wel als voormelde jongen August gegeeten hadden, de relatante gesien had dat voorseijde August (die soo door sijne baarsheijd, alsoo sijlieden die jongen nog niet lang gehad hadden, als door sijne natuurlijke onnooselheijd, altoos gewoon was sijne combaars, ofschoon geen gebrek aan kleederen had, over sijn eene arm te hangen en, wanneer het wat koud ofte guure weer was, wel om sijn lighaam te slaan) tot slapen geneegen was, had de relatante denselven, soo goed sij in ’t Maleijdsche en Portugeesche [<em>sic</em>] gebreckigerwijse had kunnen voortbrengen, gevraagt of hij August ook wilde gaan slapen, op hetwelke denselven hebbende g’antwoord van ja, had sij sulx aan dien jongen g’accordeert, en denselven sig dus omtrent, dan wel eeven beseijden, een hoop met klippen needergelegt, een steen tot sijne hoofdkussen gebeesigt, en hem met sijne voorseijde combaars toegedeckt had, sonder dat de comparante [<em>sic</em>] dien jongen meerdere geslaagen, of op dien hoop klippen had doen neederleggen, nog minder vast maaken laaten.</p>
<p>Dat naar dat dien slaaf August aldaar omtrent een uurtje geleegen had, denselven van selfs van de grond opgereesen en neevens den anderen slaaf en de Hottentots weederom aan sijn werk gegaan, mitsgaders daarbij verbleeven was totdat het volk daar meede dien dag uijtgescheijden was, sonder meerdere slage bekoomen te hebben: sijnde meergemelde August dien naardemiddag nog wel drie maalen in ’t voorhuijs geweest en door een, juijst aldaar gekoomenen en in den nagt geslaapen hebbenden, landbouwer Jan Gijsbert Olivier gesien geworden, hebbende gemelde August, voorts dien avond met het andere volk, in een en ’tselve huijsje gegeeten, en sig tot slapen begeeven; sijnde den volgenden morgen door eene kleijne Hottentot, in name Jantje, wanneer de relatante nog sliep, aan de deur tot twee maalen geklopt en alsdoen aan de relatante door denselven toegeroepen: Nonje, August is dood!, op ’twelke de relatante gesegt hebbende: Ach, loop Hottentot!, had gemelde Jantje voorts hervat: Ja! Seeker, nonje!, weshalven de relatante opgestaan sijnde, haar naar de slavenhuijs begeeven, en voormelde August, behalven de broek, naakt en dood had vinden leggen, waarna de relatante, door den slaven jongen Januarij en de Hottentot Jantje, een graf had laaten maaken, en het lijk van dien jongen doen begraaven; hebbende soo als de relatante’s morgens uijt ’t slavenhuijs terug gekoomen was, voorseijde Olivier haar in de deur van haar woonhuijs ontmoet, weetende sij egter niet of denselven naar het slavenhuijs gegaan is ofte niet, maar wel dat sij relatante met dien man over het sterven van voorseijde August niet gesprooken heeft, gelijk gemelde Olivier dan ook kort daarop vertrocken en een, toenmaals bij haar geweest sijnde, Hottentot in naame Frederik, dien man nog den weg geweesen had, hebbende de relatante meergemelde August laaten begraaven, sonder eenige buuren daarvan kennis gegeeven, of het lijk te hebben laaten besigtigen, en ook den requirant daarvan geen raport gedaan had, nog te hebben laaten doen.</p>
<p>Betuijgende de relatante laatstelijk van den slaven jongen Carel, toebehoorende den landbouwer Jacob Cloete, niet gehoort te hebben dat meergemelde Januarij tot hem soude hebben gesegt dat de relatante meergemelde August soude hebben dood geslaagen, seggende ook niet te weeten dat gerepte Januarij die woorden tot iemand anders heeft g’uijt; invoegen denselven over dusdanige gesegdens ook geene slagen heeft ontfangen, maar wel over en ter saake dat voormelde Januarij, volgens het voorgeeven van eenige Hottentotts en slaven, vergift bij hem gehad hebben soude, dog waarvan nog der relatante man, nog den daar omtrent woonende veldcorporaal Scholts, de waarheijd hadden kunnen ontdekken.</p>
