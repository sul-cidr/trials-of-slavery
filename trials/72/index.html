<p>Only a very few slaves at the Cape came from Siam (modern Thailand). The VOC had a trading post at Ayutthaya, which flourished in the seventeenth century, was closed down in 1740 but had a brief revival in 1748-65 (Gaastra 2003: 124-25; Raben &#x26; Pombejra 1997: 74-5). <a href="#summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

He was probably a former slave, since he was offered to the Council of Policy as surety by the burgher Gerrit Reijnders against the manumission of another slave in 1766 (Leibbrandt 1989: 970). Although many free blacks were too poor to own slaves, a number did so, sometimes acquiring their own relatives in order to manumit them (Elphick &#x26; Shell 1989: 221; Shell 1994: 121). Albert Isaaksz manumitted his slave Rosie and her three children in 1792, although it is not known if they were related to him (Leibbrandt 1989: 1525).

                <div class="astro-FK3CUU5Z"><p>Since Spadiltje, slave of the free black Albert Isaaksz, twenty five years old at a guess, currently their honours’ prisoners, has voluntarily confessed and, from the other evidence produced in the case, it has appeared evident to the honourable Council of Justice:</p>
<p>That the prisoner became a fugitive now fully three months ago and maintained himself both here and elsewhere in the rural areas, as well as in the region of Hanglip, where a certain runaway slave by the name of Job, belonging to the widow of the late burgher lieutenant Jan Hendrik Ekkert,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> and yet another runaway slave, whose name the prisoner says he does not know, came to join him.</p>
<p>That the prisoner and his aforementioned comrades set out to the mountains of False Bay<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-2" id="d0-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> and stayed in the region of Kalk Bay, which is where the aforesaid Job forged the plan to break into the <em>slagthuijs</em><sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-3" id="d0-translation-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> of the honourable Company in Baaij Fals and to commit theft. So that, after the said Job had made that plan known to the prisoner and the other <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-862">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-862"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em>, they all went together during the night of the 22<sup>nd</sup> of the past month August, to the aforesaid Baaij Fals, when Job climbed onto the roof, which is rather low, of the said <em>slagthuijs</em> and made an opening in the thatch of the roof by breaking or cutting to pieces the cabled yarn, through which he went into the <em>slagthuijs</em>, while the prisoner and his comrade remained outside, keeping watch.</p>
<p>That the aforesaid Job, after having broken open a chest in the said <em>slagthuijs</em>, stole from it a sum of three hundred and fifty rixdollars and four <em>schellingen</em>, consisting both of paper money<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-4" id="d0-translation-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> and a variety of silver coins, and among which there was also a guinea, as well as a black velvet jacket, a brown silk frock and a white shirt.</p>
<p>That the aforesaid Job came to the prisoner with these stolen goods and money, and in the dark gave part of the cash to him, as well as the black jacket; among which cash the prisoner afterwards found a piece of gold money. After this, the said Job and his comrade went from there to some other place with the rest of the money and clothes, while the prisoner remained in Baaij Fals.</p>
<p>That on a certain night, a day or three afterwards, the prisoner went into the tavern of Baaij Fals<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-5" id="d0-translation-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup> to have a drink, but that the people there, when they saw that the prisoner had some money with him, took him for a deserter and, moreover, also suspected him to have committed the aforesaid theft. So that he was taken prisoner by these people, searched, and then delivered into the hands of justice.</p>
<p>But since such crimes, conspiracies and robberies can under no circumstances be left unpunished in a country where justice is properly administered, and ought to be punished, according to the merits of the case, as an example to other similar malefactors.</p>
<p>Thus it is, that the aforementioned honourable Council of Justice, having read and considered the written <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-863">crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-863"><span class="header">crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie</span>Literally ‘criminal demand and conclusion.’ The document drawn up by the prosecutor based on the evidence he collected and delivered in court against an accused. The <em>conclusie</em> is the final part of the document in which the prosecutor suggested an appropriate punishment for the crime.</span></em> drawn up and delivered for and against the prisoner by the interim fiscal, <em>Sieur</em> Gabriel Exter, in his official capacity, as well as having noted everything that served in the case and could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the United Netherlands, and having judged the prisoner, Spadilje van Siam, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the usual place of execution, there to be handed over to the executioner, to be exposed with the rope around his neck under the gallows, further to be tied to a stake and to be severely scourged with rods on his bare back, as well as to be branded, then to be riveted in chains in which to labour without payment on the public works of the honourable Company on Robben Island for the duration of his life, with sentencing to the costs and expenditure of justice.<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-6" id="d0-translation-fnref-6" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Thus done and sentenced at the Cape of Good Hope on 22 September 1785, as also pronounced and executed on the 1<sup>st</sup> of the following month October and executed on the same day.<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-7" id="d0-translation-fnref-7" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup></p>

Invoegens den gevangen door die menschen gevangen genoomen, gevisiteerd, en wijders in handen van justitie overgeleevert geworden was.</p>
<p>Maar nademaal diergelijken misdaden, complotterijen en dievereijen in een land alwaar de justitie behoorlijk gehandhaafd word, geensints ongestraft kunnen worden gelaaten, en dus ten exempel van andere zulke quaaddoenders, na exigentie van zaaken, moeten worden gepunieert.</p>
