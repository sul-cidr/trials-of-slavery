<p>The limiting of a slave father’s ability to care for or to control his own children was a cause of resentment and resistance in a number of recorded cases.

<p>Radijn was presumably investigated by the Stellenbosch landdrost for assault, but there is no record that he was punished and the case was not forwarded to the Council of Justice. The case strikingly demonstrates the lack of <em>potestas</em> (legal authority or power) that slaves had over their own children. These were instead the possessions of their owners (De Kock 1950: 114; Botha 1962, vol. II: 171-72; and Schoeman 2001: 583-84). <a href="#summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>That on a Sunday evening, some time ago now, without the testifier being able to specify when, when his owner was at the Cape and the mistress had already gone to bed, while the testifier, as also the women slaves Cadace and Dina, as well as the testifier’s little son Februarij, were in the kitchen on their owner’s farm, the said Februarij ridiculed and laughed at the slave Cadace because of her speaking broken Dutch,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> over which the testifier punished him and gave him two clouts on the ears. The <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-773">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-773"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em>, Michiel Radijn, who was there, intervened, asking the testifier why he was beating this little <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-774">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-774"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> and the testifier answered: “Because he was naughty and ridiculed the old folk”, while adding: “I may beat him, he is my son, even if my <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-775">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-775"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’. In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em> were present, he would even have said: ‘Hit him!’” Thereupon, when the testifier turned himself around, he received such a blow against his head from the back that he suddenly fell down and remained lying senseless like this, until he was picked up by the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-776">meijden</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-776"><span class="header">meijden</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em> and taken into a room next to the kitchen, which is when he again came to, but was still unaware of how this blow was given to him or with what; of which, as well as his transport to the aforesaid room, the testifier was eventually informed by aforementioned Dina and Cadace.<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-2" id="d0-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing, if so required, to subsequently confirm the above.</p>
<p>Thus related at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch on 18 August 1774 in the presence of the messenger of the court Morits Herman Otto Woeke and the soldier Frederik Wagener, as witnesses.</p>
<p>This mark X was set down by the slave Julij with his own hand.</p>

<p>It is intriguing that in this case all the slaves mentioned are ‘van de Caab’ and seemingly conversing in a form of Dutch with one another, and not making use of one of the contact languages common amongst slaves at the Cape during this time (see 1775 Moses van Bengalen). This may be indicative of the fact that more and more slaves were locally born at the Cape by this stage (although full creolisation did not take place until the nineteenth century). But even though Candace seems to have grown up at the Cape, she still does not pronounce Dutch ‘correctly’, at least in the eyes of the young boy (according to her testimony, he teased her every time ‘onder het spreeken van een Duits woord door haar niet wel uitgebragt’ [when she said a Dutch word not well pronounced by her], 1/STB 3/11, testimony of Candace van de Caab, 2 August 1774, unpaginated). This may reflect something of the nature of the variety of Dutch used by Cape-born slaves, although very little is known about this topic. <a href="#d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>
