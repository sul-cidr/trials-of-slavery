  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>The authorities were constantly alarmed by the prevalence of slave desertions, especially so, as in this case, when a large group of slaves of different owners banded together. The documentation for this case is voluminous.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> Each of the eleven runaways who were recaptured gave his own reasons for running away, some of them induced by others. Of particular interest is the blood oath that they took and their vow never to ‘eat the bread of the Dutch again’, which might have been a metaphorical way of saying ‘we will never be part of them/serve them again’. They planned to escape to Namaqualand, but en route fell in with a group of San, who co-opted them into attacking Khoi herders in the Piketberg region, from whom they captured cattle and sheep. They then put up considerable armed resistance before they were recaptured by a troop of Company militia. A few of the band escaped and were never heard of again.</p>
<p>Although unusual in its scale and organisation, this episode was in one way typical of slave resistance in the VOC period. The slaves did not mount a rebellion against their owners, but rather sought to escape from them and from the colony. This was more characteristic of a slave society in its early stages, when slaves were all imported, and so aware of a world of freedom outside the Cape, rather than born into slavery in the colony. Rebellions seeking to overthrow the colony never occurred at the Cape during the VOC period, possibly because of the slow rate of creolisation.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-2" id="summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> Only in 1808 did a slave uprising take place which sought to overthrow the slave system of the Cape from within.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-3" id="summary-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>

<p>There appears before the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the here-named slave Thomas, who has answered on the questions below as is noted at the side of each:</p>
<p>Article 1: What is the prisoner’s name, age and place of birth?</p>
<p>Answer: Thomas van Bengalen, 30 years old.</p>
<p>Article 2: Whose slave he is and on what post he lived?</p>
<p>Says to be slave of Christoffel Esterhuijs, and that he had lived at the Paardeberg.</p>
<p>Article 3: At what time, when and from what cause the prisoner fled from there?</p>
<p>Answer: That he ran away with Knap een Deuntie, who had incited him to it.</p>
<p>Article 4: Which slaves the prisoner enticed, as also what his designs were in doing this?</p>
<p>Answer: That he went with Knap een Deuntie to the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-24">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-24"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> of Casper Batenhorst, who were lured by Knap een Deuntie and who fled with them, and that Knap een Deuntie had told them that they would go to the land of the Namaqua.</p>
<p>Article 5: If the prisoner, after having been gone for a considerable time, returned again to the house of his master in order to rob some sheep from there?</p>
<p>Says that he did not run away more than once, and did not seduce the slave Anthonij, nor did he flee in his company.</p>
<p>Article 6: If the prisoner forced the slave Anthonij to give up some of his master’s sheep?</p>
<p>Says no.</p>
<p>Article 7: If the aforementioned Anthonij was opposed to this and said that, if the fiscal would get to hear this, he would certainly have to hang?</p>
<p>Answer: Not to know of this.</p>
<p>Article 8: If the prisoner answered to this: “We shall never come back to the Dutch, nor eat their bread again”? Says that Knap een Deuntie did say this to him, but that he did not speak to Anthonij about this.</p>
<p>Article 9: If the prisoner, seeing that Anthonij was in no way inclined to flee, tied him up, beat him, dragged him by his hair, and threatened him that, if he did not want to go with them, his throat would be cut?</p>
<p>Not to have done this.</p>
<p>Article 10: If the prisoner dragged Anthonij, who was thus tied up, against his will to the Groene Kloof and there untied him again?</p>
<p>Answer: As above.</p>
<p>Article 11: Which other slaves the prisoner and Jeroen incited, being those of <em>Sieurs</em> Swellengrebel, Oortmans and Mulder, and if he likewise made them believe that he would bring them to another country where there would be good food and drink?</p>
<p>Answer: That Jeroen incited these slaves: yet Tromp, Jeroen, Pasqual and Jonas say that it was Thomas who told them to run away, and Jeroen says that he was present when Thomas talked to the said <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-25">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-25"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em>.</p>
<p>Article 12: To which place they set out and how strong their company was?</p>
<p>Answer: That they went to the Groene River and that they were then nine strong, being the prisoner, Jeroen, Jonas, Pasqual, Theunis, Balij, Januarij and Isaac.</p>
<p>Article 13: Where, and in what manner, they found food during this roaming around?</p>
<p>Answer: That they kept themselves alive with bread, which they had taken along with them, and that Anthonij had carried the clothes.</p>
<p>Article 14: What insolent and brazen deeds the prisoner helped to commit against the Hottentots, and if their livestock had been forced from them?</p>
<p>Says not to have committed anything brazen against the Hottentots, nor to have forced their livestock from them.</p>
<p>Article 15: If the prisoner did not also help to steal from the Hottentots five cattle and three sheep?</p>
<p>Answer: No.</p>
<p>Article 16: If the prisoner too was at the <em>kralen</em> of the Hottentot captains Couragie, Hanibal and Caesar, or where else he ended up?</p>
<p>Says not to have been there, but that he was in the Groene Cloof around the Sonquas Fontijn in order to search for food there.</p>
<p>Article 17: If the prisoner was armed with a gun and <em>assegaij</em>, and to what end he had stolen this from his master?</p>
<p>Answer: That he took with him a musket, two pairs of shoes, five sheep hides, two pairs of silver buckles, a frock coat and a jacket of his master.</p>
<p>Article 18: If the prisoner eventually gave the gun to Jeroen and with what purpose he handed it over?</p>
<p>Says that he did not do so. However, is persuaded by<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> Jonas, Pasqual, Anthonij, Tromp and Jeroen that he handed over the musket, as also that he told them that he had supported a certain <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-26">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-26"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

Moreover, that he went to the Groene Cloof in order to incite more <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-27">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-27"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>Article 19: If the prisoner was not also a co-contributor of guns, powder, shot etc., and who were his collaborators?</p>
<p>Says that Knap een Deuntie had broken open a chest of his <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-28">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-28"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’. In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em> and had stolen from it powder and shot, without him having been present. However, is persuaded by Tromp, Anthonij, Jeroen, Pasqual and Jonas that he was the provider with Knap een Deuntie of the powder and shot, as also that he had baked two hundred and sixty rusks for Claas Cok [<em>sic</em>].</p>
<p>Article 20: If the place of rendezvous was at the house of the cripple farmer?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, their place of rendezvous was there.</p>
<p>Article 21: If the prisoner also ate there with Knap een Deuntje [<em>sic</em>] a piece of bread covered in blood and took an oath of allegiance to each other in order to do the Dutch every harm and never to return to them?</p>
<p>Says not to have eaten of this. Tromp, who is present in court, says that Thomas, together with him and the other <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-29">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-29"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>Article 22: If the prisoner has to admit that Knap een Deuntje, Tromp and he, the prisoner, were the principal inducers, inciters and authors concerning the flight and the other evil that was committed?</p>
<p>Answer: That Tromp and Knap een Deuntie were the heads of the gang and that he was the corporal. Tromp, Anthonij, Jeroen, Pasqual and Jonas say that Thomas was one of the principal heads and inciters of the gang.</p>
<p>Article 23: Into how many parties they divided themselves, and if the prisoner was not also head of a troop?</p>
<p>Answer: That Knap een Deuntie and Tromp were heads of the one, as also Jeroen and the prisoner who were the heads of the other troop.</p>
<p>Article 24: Where the prisoner was roaming with his lot when Knap een Deuntje and the accomplices he had with him were defending themselves against the Dutch?</p>
<p>Says that at that time he, besides Isaac and Claas Cok, had separated from the troop and were on their way home.</p>
<p>Article 25: If the prisoner was busy inciting more <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-30">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-30"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>Answer: No.</p>
<p>Article 26: If the prisoner and two other <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-31">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-31"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

However, in South Africa a related meaning developed, right from the founding of the Cape colony, namely as a settlement of indigenous people, at first specifically the Khoikhoi but later also other indigenous peoples.</span></em>?</p>
<p>Answer: That at the mouth of the Berg River he, with the two aforementioned <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-33">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-33"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>Article 27: If they got loose during the night and thus escaped, and whither they then went?</p>
<p>Says that they cut themselves loose with a knife and that he then went to his master’s house.</p>
<p>Article 28: Where this was and what mischief was done there?</p>
<p>Answer: As in article 26 and that they had not done anything mischievous there.</p>
<p>Article 29: What roguery and wicked deeds the prisoner committed other than what have been mentioned before?</p>
<p>Says to have done no other wicked things.</p>
<p>Article 30: What was wrong with the prisoner to have perpetrated such devilish deeds?</p>
<p>Says not to know that.</p>
<p>Article 31: If the prisoner was not aware that many punishments had already been meted out here to similar rogues?</p>
<p>Answer: Not to know this.</p>
<p>Article 32: If the prisoner must not acknowledge to have made himself guilty of several offences which are punishable most severely?</p>
<p>Answer: Not to have done anything wrong.</p>
<p>Article 33: What reasons moved the prisoner, when a certain Dutchman had intended to capture him, to go to such an extreme as to want to cut his throat with a knife, of which he at present still has the scar on his neck, and in what manner he then escaped this?</p>
<p>Answer: That he had done this because he was being chased by a certain Dutchman who asked him whose <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-34">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-34"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

That the Dutchman let him lie and rode away, whereupon the prisoner went from there to his master’s house and healed himself with leaves of the oil tree.<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-3" id="d0-translation-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>

<p>The subject of this is unstated in the Dutch. It appears that others were present at the interrogation (compare article 21) who may have spoken up against him. It is equally possible that the fiscal meant: ‘<em>We</em> are convinced or persuaded by the testimonies of Jonas...’. <a href="#d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>Schoeman (2002b: 9-10) suggests that it is possible that this Claas Kok was the progenitor of the later Griqua captains. Certainly, Adam Kok, usually considered the founder of the Griquas, first entered the historical record during the 1750s when he was farming in the region of Piketberg, the area where this case was set, and his descendants later claimed that he was born the son of a slave. <a href="#d0-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>In the original a line is left open between this sentence and the one starting with ‘dog’. The first part is probably Thomas’s answer, while the part ‘dog…’ was written by the secretary or whoever did the questioning. This also occurs in question 19 below, but note also the answers to questions 18, 21 and 22 where Thomas’s answers are being compared with the evidence provided by the other slaves.
