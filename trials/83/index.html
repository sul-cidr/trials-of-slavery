  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>The evidence in this case was collected by the Stellenbosch landdrost after he received a complaint by the slave David van de Caab about the actions of his owner, Francois de Wet. David accused De Wet of causing the deaths of the young child of the slave Jacomijn, David’s partner, and, three years earlier, that of his sister, Stijn.</p>
<p>The case shows the difficulties encountered by a slave family. David formed part of a slave kinship network on the farm, albeit one which was devastated by the actions of his owner. Jacomijn, as a young mother, had been working as a wet nurse on another farm and was accused of neglecting her own child. Stijn had tried to abort her child and was whipped for being the suspected carrier of a venereal disease.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>It appears that no action was taken against De Wet. Possibly the landdrost considered that the evidence was uncertain, and that Stijn may have died from her attempted abortion.</p>

<p>Infanticide was a form of resistance amongst slave women, since it deprived their owners of the benefit of new slave property, although its emotional and psychological effects on the women should not be forgotten. Venereal disease was widespread in the colony, not least because of its spread by sailors and soldiers aboard vessels visiting Table Bay. The authorities attempted, somewhat ineffectually, to control infanticide especially, for example <em>Kaapse Plakkaatboek</em> II: 171 (1740) and 246-47 (1753). See on this De Kock 1950: 184-86; Shell 1994: 312-14; and Van der Spuy 1993: 152-98. <a href="#summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

Whenever the said Jacomijn picked up her child, who that whole day had been doing nothing but crying, and held it to her bosom, the testifier’s owner forbade it, saying in essence: “You shouldn’t think you’re with De Waal where you can sit all day long with the child on your lap”, which utterance he repeated a couple of times and when he did so again on the Tuesday thereafter, the said Jacomijn then answered him: “At <em>Sieur</em> De Waal’s I at least always had somebody to look after my child, but now there’s nobody; one day she will cry herself to death”. Whereupon the testifier’s owner became so angry over this that he took the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-975">sjambok</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-975"><span class="header">sjambok</span>This word entered seventeenth-century Dutch via Malay (<em>tjambok</em>) or Javanese (<em>sambok</em>) from Persian (<em>châbuk</em>). It is a whip cut from thick animal skin, usually hippopotamus or rhinoceros, and was already known in the Dutch East Indies as an instrument for punishing slaves. At the Cape it was also used to beat draught animals with.</span></em> for the back horses, which was hanging in the kitchen, and dealt the aforementioned Jacomijn, while she was holding the child in her arms, several blows with it, besides also dealing some blows to the child (in particular two visible wounds on its forehead) on this occasion, as a result of which the testifier’s child, who before this had been well and healthy, passed away the night of that very Tuesday, and was buried the following day. At which incident were present: the widow Jan Theron, a slave <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-976">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-976"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> of the said widow Theron, by the name of Goliad, a female Hottentot living at his owner’s, by the name of Anna, and a fellow slave of the testifier’s owner, named Fortuijn.</p>
<p>Besides which the testifier declares that, about three years ago, without wanting to determine the precise date, there had been residing at his owner’s a certain Hottentot, whose name the testifier cannot recall, who, before having served his agreed time,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-2" id="d0-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> ran away from there, and when he was captured again after some time and brought home by the slaves of the testifier’s owner, he was suffering from a venereal disease. That the testifier’s owner then asked the said Hottentot where he had got this disease, and received as answer that it was the sister of the testifier, viz. the slave Stijn, with whom he had been having a relationship. Upon this, the testifier’s owner immediately gave the said woman slave, who was already ill, but still up and about, a thrashing with a back <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-977">sjambok</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-977"><span class="header">sjambok</span>This word entered seventeenth-century Dutch via Malay (<em>tjambok</em>) or Javanese (<em>sambok</em>) from Persian (<em>châbuk</em>).

<p>At that time, when the testifier went on his way here in order to inform the honourable petitioner of this incident with his sister, and at the same time to complain about the harsh treatment of his said owner, the brother-in-law of his owner, named Jacobus du Toit, followed the testifier with two horses, caught up with him in the vicinity of the farm of the burgher Charl Theron, and convinced him to go and sit on one of these horses and to ride back home with him, which the testifier also did.<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-3" id="d0-translation-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The testifier says that when he recollects the misfortune his family has had to endure, already twice now, as a result of the strict treatment of his owner, it is impossible for him, on account of his regret and grief, to continue serving the same, and he therefore in addition requests the honourable petitioner not to be returned again to his said owner.</p>
<p>There being nothing more to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, declaring it to be the whole truth.</p>
<p>Thus related at the office of the secretary at Stellenbosch on 10 January 1792.</p>

<p>That about three years ago, without the deponent being able to determine the exact date, when the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-980">manhafte</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-980"><span class="header">manhafte</span>This word is related to Dutch <em>manhaftig</em>, ‘manly, manful, valiant.’ It was the title held by officers of the various citizen militias (each district had one). It seems as if it only entered common usage late in the eighteenth century.</span></em> Francois de Wet, at whose place the deponent had already been living twelve or more years, was going to drive to Stellenbosch with his wife, the slave of the said De Wet, named Steijn, wanted very much to go with them. And since her <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-981">juffrouw</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-981"><span class="header">juffrouw</span>Strictly speaking this contraction of <em>jonkvrouw</em> was the form of address for a noble lady (as with <em>jonker</em>, the contraction of <em>jonkheer</em>, ‘lord’), but at the Cape it was more generally used by settlers for women with some social status.

That the said slave became ill from this and, when asked by her <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-982">juffrouw</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-982"><span class="header">juffrouw</span>Strictly speaking this contraction of <em>jonkvrouw</em> was the form of address for a noble lady (as with <em>jonker</em>, the contraction of <em>jonkheer</em>, ‘lord’), but at the Cape it was more generally used by settlers for women with some social status.

Whereupon the deponent’s <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-983">juffrouw</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-983"><span class="header">juffrouw</span>Strictly speaking this contraction of <em>jonkvrouw</em> was the form of address for a noble lady (as with <em>jonker</em>, the contraction of <em>jonkheer</em>, ‘lord’), but at the Cape it was more generally used by settlers for women with some social status.

<p>That another slave of the aforementioned De Wet, by the name of Jacomijn, after having been at Vier en Twintig Rivieren at Johannes de Waal, the brother-in-law of her owner, to suckle the child of De Waal, again returned home on a certain Sunday during the recently passed month of December. Among other things, some days thereafter she went out to cut pig leaves,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-5" id="d0-translation-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup> leaving her sick child at home, and when this work was done and she had come back, she pitifully abused this child who, during the absence of its mother, had been doing nothing but screaming, by beating it, so that even her husband, the slave David, asked her why she was beating the child so much, adding: “One day you will beat it to death”, and received as answer in essence: “It has nothing to do with you!”</p>
<p>The deponent’s <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-984">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-984"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’. In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em>, who upon this noise had come from the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-985">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-985"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch).

At the Cape it was also used to beat draught animals with.</span></em> the aforementioned Jacomijn two or three lashes over the arms while she was carrying the child in her arms, whereupon the said slave hurriedly ran into the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-987">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-987"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch).

<p>That the aforementioned Jacomijn that evening went to bed in an outside room with her child, who was by then even more ill than before, and when she again got up the following morning, and also when she came into the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-988">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-988"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch).

<p>There being nothing more to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of her statement as in the text, declaring this to be the whole truth.</p>
<p>Thus recorded at the office of the secretary at Stellenbosch on 11 January 1792.</p>

Most of the titles used for these ranks were derived from the merchant origins of the VOC, but in practice a rank did not equate with a person’s function. <em>Koopman</em>, literally meaning ‘merchant,’ was a rank in the third category, senior to <em>onderkoopman</em> (‘junior merchant’), but below an <em>opperkoopman</em> (‘chief merchant’).</span></em> Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, declares it to be true:</p>
<p>That on a certain evening about three years ago, without being able to determine the exact date, the deponent went from his work, which he had done elsewhere on the fields that day, to the house and, when he entered the kitchen, he saw with amazement that the slave of his said owner, named Stijn, who was well and healthy when the deponent had left that morning, was lying dead there in the kitchen, without the deponent being able to say how or from what the same passed away, being only able to discover from the remains that she had shortly before been vomiting a lot. On that same evening this slave was taken, on the order of his said owner, to an outside room by the deponent, his fellow slave David and some other fellow slaves belonging to his owner, whose names the deponent is unable to recollect because of the long duration and time, and was buried in the morning of the following day.</p>
<p>That about fourteen days before the last New Year, when the slave Jacomijn went out to collect so-called pig leaves, she left her suckling child, who had returned home ill with her, shortly before this, from the brother-in-law of the deponent’s owner, the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-992">manhafte</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-992"><span class="header">manhafte</span>This word is related to Dutch <em>manhaftig</em>, ‘manly, manful, valiant.’ It was the title held by officers of the various citizen militias (each district had one).

That when the said Jacomijn returned, she chastised this child over this to such an extent that the aforesaid David, with whom the said Jacomijn has a relationship, addressed her with this question: “Why are you beating the child like that, you will beat it to death one day”. That when the aforesaid owner of the testifier [<em>sic</em>] came in upon this, he gave Jacomijn, who was carrying her child in her arms, three lashes with an ordinary <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-993">sjambok</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-993"><span class="header">sjambok</span>This word entered seventeenth-century Dutch via Malay (<em>tjambok</em>) or Javanese (<em>sambok</em>) from Persian (<em>châbuk</em>).

<p>This suggests an arrangement whereby the Khoi worker was contracted for a fixed period of time. It may be that this person was in fact a <em>Bastaard-Hottentot,</em> who was indentured until the age of twenty-five after 1775 (see 1752 April van de Caab n. 1).

<p>David was setting out to complain to the landdrost. It appears from this that Jacobus du Toit did not force him to return, but rather attempted to persuade him to do so by less forceful means.
