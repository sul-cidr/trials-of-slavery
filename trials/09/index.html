  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>In this case the slave Anthonij van Mallabaar brought an accusation to the fiscal that his owner had murdered his fellow slave, Januarij van Mallabaar.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> Murder of a slave by an owner was a punishable offence and Anthonij clearly knew this.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-2" id="summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> The court dismissed Anthonij’s claim and he was beaten, branded and sent back to his owner for making a false accusation. Usually a surgeon’s report was made on the body of a slave who had died in unknown or suspicious circumstances, but there is no reference to such a report in this case.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-3" id="summary-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>
<p>A paragraph in the <em>sententie</em> is crossed out. It indicates that Anthonij confessed that he had brought the accusation to avenge himself on his owner, who had maltreated him. It is unclear why this was deleted, possibly because it played no role in the deliberation of the case, which was about Anthonij’s false complaint against his owner, not about what his owner did or did not do.</p>

<p>There appears before the undersigned deputised members from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the here-named slave Anthoni van Mallebaar, who answered on the questions below as is noted besides each.</p>
<p>Article 1: The prisoner’s name, place of birth and age.</p>
<p>Answer: Anthoni van Mallebaar, 24 years old at a guess.</p>
<p>Article 2: When the prisoner came to report to the honourable fiscal that his master had supposedly beaten to death a slave?</p>
<p>Answer: About a month ago.</p>
<p>Article 3: If the prisoner meant with this Januarij van Malabaer, at that time a cattle herder on his master’s post?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 4: If three cattle of his master had gone missing shortly one after the other, while the prisoner had still been at the post, and if this had been the result of the said Januarij’s negligence?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 5: If the said Januarij then fled, and was brought home to his master, after some days, by the farmer Jan Steenkamp?</p>
<p>Answer: That two <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-44">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-44"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> of Jan Steenkamp brought Januarij home, and that Steenkamp also came there shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Article 6: If it had been at this time that Januarij on the order of his master was chastised by the other <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-45">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-45"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 7: If this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-46">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-46"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>Answer: That after the punishment he received, this <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-47">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-47"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>Article 8: Where the prisoner found Januarij [lying] for dead, and who else was present and saw this?</p>
<p>Answer: That on the same day that the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-48">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-48"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

That after they had milked in the evening, the shepherd Januari van Bengalen found this beaten Januarij dead, and told all the slaves that he had found the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-53">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-53"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>Article 9: If he had given this report to the honourable fiscal of his own volition, or if he had been incited by somebody, and who that was?</p>
<p>Answer: They, the slaves, amongst themselves.</p>
<p>Article 10: Where Januarij was buried and by whom? Answer: It was not done by the slaves, it must have been done by the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-54">baas</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-54"><span class="header">baas</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used both in the sense of ‘head’ (e.g. ‘head carpenter’) and ‘master’.

<p>Article 11: What excuse he could offer for this, his sham?</p>
<p>Answer: Not being able to give any excuse except for what he had said before.</p>
<p>Thus done and answered, and thus interpreted into the Dutch as well as the Portuguese languages, at the Cape of Good Hope on 30 September 1718.</p>

<p>Verification</p>
<p>There appears before the undersigned deputised members from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, the aforementioned slave Anthonij van Mallebaar, who, after the answers he gave to the questions put to him had been read out word by word, clearly and plainly, declares to fully persist by them, not desiring that anything more be added or taken from them, except that Januarij did not run away for the third time, as he was asked in article 7; moreover, on article 8, that he had been the first to have found the late Januarij van Mallabaar dead, but that he did not make any of this known to the other slaves, until in the end Januarij van Bengalen had discovered the death of the aforesaid Januarij and made it known.</p>
<p>Thus verified in the Portuguese language, as well as being interpreted into the Dutch, in the Castle of Good Hope on 12 October 1718.</p>
<p>This mark X was set down by Anthoni van Mallebaar.</p>

<p>How the prisoner, in the month of August this year, did not scruple nor hesitate to go from his master’s farm to the honourable independent fiscal, Cornelis van Beaumont, and to falsely accuse his aforesaid master of having beaten to death a certain slave by the name of Januarij van Mallabaar.</p>
<p>&#x3C;That the prisoner, had done this on his own accord, solely to avenge himself in this wicked way on his said master, because (as the prisoner asserts) the same beats and torments him daily.><sup><a href="#d1-translation-fn-1" id="d1-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>

<p>All of which are matters of the most evil consequences, which may under no circumstances be tolerated in a country where justice is administered properly, but should be averted and punished most severely as an example and deterrent to all such villains.</p>
<p>Therefore, the honourable Council of Justice of this government, serving today, having seen and read the written <em>crimineelen eijsch en conclusie</em>, produced by the honourable landdrost Jacob Voet in his official capacity, as also the prisoner’s voluntary confession, properly verified in court, with the other documents bearing upon the case, further having pondered with attention everything that could possibly serve the case and could have moved their honours, practising justice in the name and on behalf of the high and mighty Lords States General of the free United Netherlands, having judged the prisoner, is sentencing him with this: to be taken to the place where criminal sentences are usually executed here and there to be handed over to the executioner and to be tied to a stake, to be scourged on the bare back with rods and to be branded, afterwards to be sent home to his master, provided the same pays the costs and expenditure of justice.<sup><a href="#d1-translation-fn-3" id="d1-translation-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Thus done and sentenced in the Castle of Good Hope on 1 December 1718.</p>
