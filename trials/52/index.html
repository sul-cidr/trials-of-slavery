  <header class="astro-LMWD7RQC">Summary</header>
  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>This is one of the most complex and revealing cases about slavery in the criminal records of the Council of Justice.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> It involved what one historian has described as a ‘minor slave uprising’, in circumstances that greatly alarmed the authorities and colonists.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-2" id="summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The events involved a group of slave runaways on Table Mountain who fought pitched battles with the burghers. They sent particular panic through Cape Town when some of them, inspired by the revenge of Achilles van de West Cust against his owner, murdered Michiel Smuts and his family in their Oranjezicht home.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-3" id="summary-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> After a series of encounters with other slaves and skirmishes with commandos, some were killed (and some summarily executed on the spot). Januarij van Boegies, the sole survivor of the original gang, was brought to justice, together with eleven other slaves who had later joined it or provided it with food or support. The original group of runaways on Table Mountain had drawn over twenty slaves into its net by this time.</p>
<p>A particularly intriguing aspect of the case is the role played by one of the slaves, September van Boegies, whose interrogation is transcribed here along with the <em>sententie</em>. Called ‘father’ by the others, he was clearly a figure of authority, both because of his seniority in age and because of his traditional Bugis medical knowledge. His interrogation is unusually revealing of the cultural and social worlds of Southeast Asian slaves at the Cape, including notions of kinship, medicine, language and concepts of time.</p>
<p>Included in the court records is an intriguing document – a letter in the Bougies language, written to September by another slave from Bougies, one Upas, who lived in Stellenbosch.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-4" id="summary-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> The content had nothing to do with the case in question, but even the possession of a letter written in a strange script and language from one Bougies slave to another was considered by the authorities to be suspicious, especially since they feared that reading and written communication amongst slaves might facilitate an uprising.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-5" id="summary-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup> On the basis of this evidence, September was accused of fostering revolt among the Bougies slaves of the colony, and this was as alarming to the authorities as the attack on the Smuts family. This accounts for September’s gruesome execution: he had played no part in the attack on the Smuts homestead, although he had subsequently provided the runaways with food and medical assistance.</p>

The murder led to an immediate banning of slave wood-collecting on the mountain, the enforcement of controls over slaves gathering in Cape Town streets at night without lanterns, and the requirement that they carry letters from their owners showing that they had permission to be out of their owner’s sight (<em>Kaapse Plakkaatboek</em> III: 30-1). The ban on wood-collecting was rescinded on 7 August (<em>Kaapse Plakkaatboek</em> III: 31-2), but slaves were ordered to report sightings of any runaways on the mountain. The fear of a Bougies-inspired uprising in this and subsequent cases involving East Indian slave resistance confirmed the stereotype of Bugis slaves as ‘treacherous’, and contributed to the (ineffectual) banning of the further importation of East Indian slaves to the Cape in 1767. <em>Plakkaten</em> to enforce this had to be periodically issued, <em>Kaapse Plakkaatboek</em> III: 164 (1784) and IV: 80-1 (1792); see discussion for causes of this ban in Worden 1985: 44 and Shell 1994: 43 n. 8 and 233. <a href="#summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, September van Boegies, who has answered to the questions below as noted to their sides.</p>
<p>Article 1: What is the prisoner’s name, age and place of birth?</p>
<p>Answer: September van Boegies, fifty years old at a guess.</p>
<p>Article 2: Whose bondsman the prisoner is?</p>
<p>Answer: Of the widow Adriaan Heuning.</p>
<p>Article 3: How long a time it is since the prisoner was first informed of that gang of deserters, and where it was that he had first spoken to them?</p>
<p>Answer: It was after the ploughing season that I first spoke to them at the Platte Cloof.</p>
<p>Article 4: How strong this group was when he spoke to them for the first time?</p>
<p>Answer: Three.</p>
<p>Article 5: To whom these runaway slaves belong, and how they are named?</p>
<p>Answer: One of Bergman, one of Verweij, and Adonis.</p>
<p>Article 6: If there was present amongst these runaway slaves a slave <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-607">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-607"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> named Fortuijn, who, about a full year ago now, had wounded his owner Cornelis Verweij with a knife?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 7: If this said Fortuijn is the prisoner’s brother or half-brother?</p>
<p>Answer: No.</p>
<p>Article 8: If not, why did they then always address each other in this way?</p>
<p>Answer: Because it is the custom amongst the Bugis.</p>
<p>Article 9: How strong this gang of runaway slaves was in fact?</p>
<p>Answer: Thirteen men.</p>
<p>Article 10: For how long a period the prisoner had provided these runaway slaves with food and tobacco?</p>
<p>Answer: Two weeks, over and above what they had obtained from the other slaves.</p>
<p>Article 11: If these slaves, while they were staying in the dunes at Blaauwberg, once came to fetch food from the prisoner and his comrades at the Platte Cloof?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Article 12: How often were these deserters with him in the slave house?</p>

<p>Answer: Julij.</p>
<p>Article 16: If it had been Julij of Bergman?</p>
<p>Answer: As above.</p>
<p>Article 17: If the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-609">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-609"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>Answer: Fortuijn told it to me.</p>
<p>Article 19: If the prisoner also gave a letter to Adonis?</p>
<p>Answer: Not to Adonis, but Julij had given a letter to Januarij.</p>
<p>Article 20: What was written in that letter?</p>
<p>Answer: Nothing other than that he could protect his body from evil by it.</p>
<p>Article 21: What agreement did they reach with one another at this time?</p>
<p>Answer: The deserters bade me to run away too, though I did not wish to do so.</p>
<p>Article 22: With what were the said slaves armed at this time?</p>
<p>Answer: They did not bring any guns along.</p>
<p>Article 23: If, about fourteen days thereafter, thirteen to fourteen deserters were brought into the slave house by the prisoner, amongst whom were also those six deserters who had been in the slave house fourteen days before?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, thirteen.</p>

<p>Answer: The candle remained burning.</p>
<p>Article 25: If this had been performed by Januarij?</p>
<p>Answer: As above.</p>
<p>Article 26: If the prisoner, while the deserters were in his sleeping place, where he had a candle, handed over a letter to Julij?</p>
<p>Answer: No! Julij read his own letter.</p>
<p>Article 27: With what were they armed at this time?</p>
<p>Answer: They had knives at their sides, and nothing else.</p>

<p>Answer: As on the aforegoing article.</p>
<p>Article 29: What kind of mutual agreement did they reach amongst themselves at this time?</p>

It was thus often used as a short-hand term for common labourers.

This usage lived on in modern Afrikaans <em>plaasvolk</em>, ‘farm labourers.’</span></em> to September at the Platte Cloof”?</p>

<p>Article 55: What do the contents of this letter consist of?</p>
<p>Answer: That because the slave Oepas was continually ill, he requested me to come to him.</p>
<p>Article 56: What reasons did the prisoner have to claim, when the honourable petitioner interrogated him about this gang for the first time, that it was only nine men strong and that seven of them were heavily wounded?</p>
<p>Answer: I heard that from Christiaan.</p>
<p>Article 57: If this was not to mislead the honourable petitioner by it?</p>
<p>Answer: No.</p>
<p>Article 58: If the prisoner would have acted as the head of his gang?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, I was requested to do that by my house <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-616">volk</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-616"><span class="header">volk</span>In seventeenth-century Dutch this was used to refer either to a group of people in the sense of ‘nation,’ or more commonly a group of people acting or working together.

<p>Article 59: What reasons did the prisoner have to embark upon such pernicious designs?</p>
<p>Answer: I did not want to run away.</p>
<p>Article 60: If the prisoner should not admit now that, because of the conspiracy with and the giving of food to a gang of thirteen to fourteen murderers, the enticement of his fellow slaves, as also their mutually intended pernicious designs: to run away to the land of the <em>Caffers</em>, to plunder some farms, to steal guns and powder and to murder everybody who might try to prevent them on their way, he is severely punishable?</p>
<p>Answer: Over the conspiracy with the gang of murderers and the giving of food, I admit to be punishable, but as to the enticement of my fellow slaves I have no guilt, and because I knew it was wrong, I did not wish to go along to the land of the <em>Caffers</em>; however, of the plundering of farms and the murdering of people I know nothing, but I did hear from the other slaves that they wanted to take gunpowder from their farm, but I did not agree to this.</p>

<p>That since some time ago, certain of the bondsmen of both the inhabitants of this place and those of the rural areas ran away from their owners and, some earlier, some later, congregated with one another at Table Mountain until they reached the number of fifteen men. That this gang was then, as soon as their hiding place became known, attacked in a cavern of the Windberg<sup><a href="#d1-translation-fn-1" id="d1-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> by some burghers who used every means possible to overpower and capture them, without, however, being successful at this time on account of their vehement resistance – both through shooting with a pistol and by throwing down heavy stones on the aforesaid burghers – and because this gang of runaway slaves escaped by fleeing after one of theirs, by the name of Cardoes, belonging to the soldier Hendrik Thomas, was shot dead by the said burghers, and who then retreated to the back of Table Mountain to a different cavern. From where one of these scoundrels, by the name of Jacob van Boegies, bondsman of the burgher Jan Smid, proceeded to the farm of the burgher cornet Jacob van Rheenen, in order to steel sheep from the corral for their subsistence, which is when, while he was executing his intended theft, he was shot and wounded in such a way that he died shortly thereafter in the mountain from the wounds he received, after which there remained in that gang still thirteen men.</p>
<p>That one of the men who belonged to this gang was a slave <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-619">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-619"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> of the farmer Cornelis Verweij, by the name of Fortuijn van Boegies, who, fully a year ago, had dangerously wounded his said owner and then escaped by fleeing, and since then had been appointed by this gang as their captain. The said Fortuijn suggested to his gang of scoundrels the necessity of looking for and obtaining guns, whereupon the slave <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-620">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-620"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

On the 14<sup>th</sup> of the recently passed month July they set out by evening from their cavern and took their course to the aforementioned garden-plot and arrived at seven o’clock in a ditch situated not far from it. Here they kept themselves hidden for some time while the aforementioned Cupido van Boegies proceeded to the garden-plot of his aforementioned owner and returned, not long after that, to the corral, whither the whole gang had in the meantime drawn closer in the darkness, bringing with him another slave <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-622">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-622"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

In South Africa the second meaning developed further, and thus <em>baas</em> came to be a synonym for <em>meester</em> (‘master’). It was the form that slaves (and Khoikhoi) would use to address male Europeans.</span></em>, and now he will die!”,<sup><a href="#d1-translation-fn-2" id="d1-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> but also returned ahead to the house in order to put everything in place which would help to facilitate this murder, seeing that he not only prevented an old slave <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-624">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-624"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

It was thus often used as a short-hand term for common labourers. Although the word was used in this latter meaning at the Cape to refer to European labourers, it eventually – due to the racial divide in the labour situation – came to refer to both slaves and Khoikhoi in the sense of manual labourers. This usage lived on in modern Afrikaans <em>plaasvolk</em>, ‘farm labourers.’</span></em> out there!”, but also immediately put out the lamp burning in the kitchen, so that, at about eight o’clock, the slave <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-626">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-626"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

In most houses this was a room, although in the later design of some Cape houses it referred to a narrower passage (like a hall or vestibule) flanked by one or more front rooms.</span></em>, where these three scoundrels not only took, in the most gruesome fashion, the lives of the aforementioned Smuts, who had been sitting there writing peacefully, as well as of his wife, who had been sitting next to him on a chair, but also that of their little son, who had been lying asleep on a chair close by and who woke up during the abominable murder of his father and mother and started to scream. Thereafter they called inside from their gang, who had surrounded the house from the outside during the execution of these cruel murders, two more [slaves] by the names of Julij and Adonis, plundered the house and stole, apart from three muskets, lead and powder, from a cabinet: linen, silver spoons, as well as some other silverware and so on. With all of these goods this whole gang of murderers – amongst whom was also to be found the second prisoner, Januarij, who had run away from his aforesaid master about a year ago now, after only having been here in this country for a short period – set out, without returning to the mountain, to the dunes at Blaauwberg, where they kept hidden for some days and maintained themselves with mussels, which they went to search on the beach, and with some sheep, which some of these murderers had stolen from Jan Biesjeskraal,<sup><a href="#d1-translation-fn-3" id="d1-translation-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> as also with such food as they went to fetch from some slaves of the widow Heuning, which slaves had been, since a considerable time theretofore, providing this gang with food and tobacco, which was collected by some of them, usually on Fridays, from the bushes in the vicinity of the Platte Cloof.</p>
<p>That a few days after this, the gang of murderers was discovered there by a commando of both militia from the honourable Company and burghers, and when they were, as far as possible, besieged in a large dune or shrub by this commando, they not only defended themselves against them, but also shot dead one of the grenadiers, although two of these scoundrels, named Baloc of the burgher Jochem Daniel Hubenaar and Jamil, belonging to the widow Dorse, were likewise shot dead by the commando, while the remaining eleven grasped the opportunity the darkness of night afforded to escape by fleeing, and proceeded the following night close to the farm of the widow Heuning, where they spoke to the third prisoner September who, seeing that he is an old <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-628">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-628"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em>, is called “Father” by the other slaves of the widow Heuning and is considered as such, and who had gone out on the pretext of going to fetch wood. This September, when he had returned to his fellow slaves, said in essence to them: “There are deserters in the veld who must get food”, when the fourth prisoner, Januarij, according to what he says, then went with two of his fellow slaves, by the names of Matthij and Jacob, to that place with the food, and found there three of these deserters, by the names of Fortuijn, Julij and Adonis, and handed over to them the food that they had brought, without having seen the other deserters since they kept themselves hidden somewhere further down. Shortly thereafter, there came into the slave house on the farm Plattecloof the slave <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-629">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-629"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> Baatjoe van Boegies, who also formed part of this gang of murderers and had been shot through his hand during their resistance of the commando, whose wound was bandaged by the third prisoner, September, after he had first purified it in the Bugis fashion, and was then put up that night by the aforementioned September above the baking oven to sleep in the bed of the slave Jacob.</p>
<p>That of the whole gang there were still alive eleven scoundrels, who afterwards, when they again got to the other runaways on Table Mountain, after staying there for two nights, departed from there to the Cape dunes, where they asked for and received food from certain slave <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-630">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-630"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> who were busy in a corral gauging wood.<sup><a href="#d1-translation-fn-4" id="d1-translation-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> As soon as the gang had departed, one of these slaves went to the Cape and told of the route they had taken, which enabled a commando to be sent out again for these murderers, which reached them in the dunes around the so-called Swarte Klip<sup><a href="#d1-translation-fn-5" id="d1-translation-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup> and attacked them, and although they did not hesitate to violently resist this commando again, seven of them, by the names of Fortuijn, belonging to the farmer Cornelis Verweij, Patientie of the burgher Willem Engels, April of the fellow burgher Jan Smid, Cupido of the aforementioned Smuts, Julij of the soldier Bergman, Adonis of the widow Rotenburg and Christiaan of the honourable Company, were shot dead, or otherwise lost their lives, while the remaining four, named April van Bima of Adam Ceijse, September van Balij of Hendrik Ridder, Baatjoe of Jan Smid and Januarij of Abraham Craaijwinkel, were taken prisoner wounded, but since with the first two of these latter ones there was <em>periculum in mora<sup><a href="#d1-translation-fn-6" id="d1-translation-fnref-6" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup></em> on account of their heavy wounds, they received their well-deserved punishment on the spot; while the corpses of the killed, as also that of Baatjoe van Boegies who suddenly died of an illness which came over him, were executed as a spectacle to other malefactors and also considering the situation; so that of this whole gang of murderers only the second prisoner, Januarij van Boegies, remained alive.</p>
<p>That the third prisoner, September van Boegies, who was assigned as a shepherd of his mistress on her aforesaid farm situated at Plattecloof, and who was the first to have met the aforesaid gang of deserters and murderers in the veld, not only informed his fellow slaves, by the names of Januarij van Maccasser, Matthijs van Mallebaar, Adam van Sambouwa, Jacob van Madagascar, Manus van Mandhaar, Isaac van Boegies and Gedult van de Caab, or the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth prisoners, of this, but moreover also ensured, both for a considerable time and even after the cruel murders of the late <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-631">boekhouder</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-631"><span class="header">boekhouder</span>The administrative or civil sector of the VOC was divided into six categories of rank, with the governor-general at the head of the first one. Most of the titles used for these ranks were derived from the merchant origins of the VOC, but in practice a rank did not equate with a person’s function. A <em>boekhouder</em> (literally ‘bookkeeper’) was a rank in the fifth category, just above that of ‘assistant’, and below that of an <em>onderkoopman</em> (‘junior merchant’).</span></em> Michiel Smuts, his wife and child were perpetrated, that they were provided with food by him and his aforementioned fellow slaves, as well as two slaves of the burgher Jan le Roex junior, named Februarij and November, or the eleventh and twelfth prisoners, who had been requested and persuaded to do so by the third and fourth prisoners, September and Januarij, which food they stole in all kinds of ways from their mistress and master, so that the aforesaid could hand it over to that gang.</p>
<p>That instead of maintaining this gang, the last-named ten prisoners were far from informing on them to the appropriate place, in accordance with their duty, in which case they could have been discovered and captured in time and thus all of the further trouble could have been prevented. That they not only often allowed some of this aforementioned gang and on one occasion all of them, every one of which was armed with various weapons, at night and other unseasonable hours into the slave house on the farm of the widow Heuning, but in addition to this, when the third and fourth prisoners, September and Januarij, were informed by two of this gang that they were of the intention to plunder the garden-plot of the aforementioned Smuts, De Windmoolen, and the farm of Claas Jonasz in order to obtain guns, lead and powder; they all agreed – but as regards most of the aforementioned slaves of the widow Heuning, principally through the doing and on the suggestion of the said September – in that slave house with this gang of deserters that as soon as the warm season comes, or as some of the prisoners say: when the barley would have ripened, they would all run away with the aforementioned gang of deserters and murderers on a long journey to the land of the <em>Caffers</em>. Next, the aforementioned September and Januarij likewise suggested this to the eleventh and twelfth prisoners, Februarij and November of Jan le Roex, and the said September also the thirteenth prisoner, named Cupido van Bengalen, belonging to the burgher councillor, <em>Sieur</em> Jan Meijdertsz Cruijwagen, to which the said Cupido – in spite of the fact that in the year 1738 he was already sentenced by this honourable Council of Justice for a similar crime and was scourged at the place of justice here<sup><a href="#d1-translation-fn-7" id="d1-translation-fnref-7" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup> – as well as the aforementioned prisoners, willingly agreed, with only the seventh and tenth prisoners trying to excuse themselves from it by profanely pretending that they were forced to it by the threats of September and Januarij; so that the twelve last prisoners were all of the intention to undertake this journey, for which journey the said September took it upon him to ensure that by that time there would not only be more slaves of his nation to go along thither, but also that they would then take along all such gunpowder as might be found on the farm of his mistress, the widow Heuning. However, the prisoners do not want to admit that they intended violence in case they were unable to obtain this [powder] secretly, but the third prisoner, September, did confess that he had asked the cook on the farm of his mistress, by the name of Slammat, for gunpowder, without however getting any.</p>
<p>And since he, September, acted as a doctor amongst the slaves of the Bugis nation in this country, and moreover would provide any slave of this nation, who had come to him to request this, with letters written in the Bugis language which would serve to that end [i.e. of healing], it would therefore have been very easy for him, under this pretext, to incite a good number of his people to increase his gang, and moreover, through committing all kinds of cruelties later, to have made their way towards the fulfilment of their mutually planned dangerous and depraved designs, had it not been discovered in time and fortunately prevented through proper means, and the prisoners got into the hands of justice.</p>
