  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>Given the Company’s fear of slave resistance in the late 1730s, and the uncertainties of the frontier districts, it is not surprising that the Stellenbosch authorities showed concern at reports that Jan Hendrik Hop had left his slaves unsupervised and with unrestricted access to guns and ammunition on his farm in the Piketberg region. Hop had a number of farm properties, doubtless as a form of investment, and did not reside on this one. Although it was not in itself unusual for burghers in the eighteenth century to own more than one farm (often including loan farms and cattle posts in the pastoral regions), the fact that there was no member of the owner’s family or <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-367">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-367"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> to supervise the slaves was exceptional and was noticed, undoubtedly with some concern, by the other settlers.</p>
<p>The testimonies by neighbouring farmers add interesting details, including that the slaves were planning to go and hunt in the veld, that some were fearful of being shot at by ‘Dutchmen’ but were intimidated by one of their number who threatened them with the kind of whipping that an owner usually gave, and that slaves did not usually wear white shirts. Dress, as much as gun ownership, defined status in the colony.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>There is no record that this case was taken further, but doubtless Hop was given a warning by the landdrost.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-2" id="summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>

<p>That during this current year, without knowing the actual date, while riding with the burgher Albert van Zeijl to his farm, situated down in the Lang Vallei, the deponent rode up with the same to the post of the former burgher councillor, <em>Sieur</em> Jan Hendrik Hop, situated at Piketberg, and known in common parlance as the Drogerijskloof, where at this time there was stationed nobody but the slaves of the said <em>Sieur</em> Hop.</p>
<p>That at that time the deponent saw in an open-standing room some rifles, as well as trap guns, with which was also a bandolier with a powder-horn and a shot-locker; while the deponent, on several previous occasions, has seen that there were also powder and bullets at that place.</p>
<p>The deponent also declares that, some time ago, he understood from the burgher Erasmus Smit that one Sunday, when the same was riding past the aforesaid farm of <em>Sieur</em> Hop, he had seen two <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-370">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-370"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> shooting with guns at a target, and that he had asked a Hottentot <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-371">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-371"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em>, who came to him from the house, who were shooting there at a target, to which the same answered him that it was two <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-372">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-372"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>Today, 26 November 1742, there appears before me, Arnold Schephausen, secretary of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the burgher Nicolaas Pilletje, who, on the requisition of the landdrost, <em>Sieur</em> Pieter Lourensz, declares it to be true:</p>
<p>That during the previous year 1741, the deponent was riding from the farm of the burgher Abraham Mouton to his home, and when he came to the farm of the former burgher councillor, <em>Sieur</em> Jan Hendrik Hop, in the Bergvallei, he saw an ox-wagon standing there, next to which were some of <em>Sieur</em> Hop’s slaves, who were waiting there to ride into the veld to shoot game, having with them two guns and a bandolier.</p>
<p>That the deponent asked one of these slaves, who was the keeper of this post and named Alexander:<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> “Where do you want to go to with this wagon”, to which the same answered: “I want to ride into the veld to shoot game”, to which the deponent replied: “You may not do that; after all, it is forbidden”, to which this slave answered the deponent most impudently: “What? I shall ride into the veld”.</p>
<p>That thereupon the deponent heard, while riding away, that the other slaves said to the aforementioned Alexander: “We don’t want to ride into the veld, there is that Dutchman<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-2" id="d0-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> who has seen us, and who would no doubt chase after us and would shoot us dead in the veld”, to which the aforementioned Alexander replied: “What, you will go with me, or I shall tie you onto the ladder and beat you”, but the deponent could not hear anything further about what had happened between them, as he was continuing on his way home.</p>
<p>The deponent finally declares as well that, on several occasions, he had seen some rifles, both on the farm of said <em>Sieur</em> Hop in the Bergvallei as well as at Piketberg, where there were stationed only slaves of the aforementioned <em>Sieur</em> Hop.</p>
<p>There being nothing further to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, while offering to subsequently confirm this, his deposition, at all times with solemn oaths, if it may be required.</p>
<p>Thus recorded at Stellenbosch, in the presence of the deputy Jan Hendrik Narb and the messenger of the court Jan van Ellewe, requested hereto as witnesses of faith.</p>

<p>Today, 24 December 1742, there appears before me, Arnold Schephausen, secretary of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the farmer Erasmus Smit, who, on the requisition of the landdrost, <em>Sieur</em> Pieter Lourensz, declares it to be the whole truth:</p>
<p>That now some time ago, without knowing exactly when, the deponent was riding from his farm, situated at Het Kruis, to that of the burgher Jacobus Gildenhuijsen, situated at Piketberg and, passing the farm of the former burgher councillor, <em>Sieur</em> Jan Hendrik Hop, at Piketberg, he saw that shots were being fired from the corner of the corral on this farm, whereupon he asked a Hottentot <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-373">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-373"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em>, who resided with the said <em>Sieur</em> Hop and who was looking after the ewes and their lambs close by the house: “Who is shooting there?”, to which the same answered him: “Those are two <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-374">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-374"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

That is Galenje and Latijn, they are shooting at a target”, whereupon the deponent proceeded from there to the aforesaid Gildenhuijsen.</p>
<p>The deponent also declares that he is aware, and has also often seen, that the slaves who are stationed without a <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-376">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-376"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> on the farm of said <em>Sieur</em> Hop have rifles among them, as well as bandoliers.</p>
