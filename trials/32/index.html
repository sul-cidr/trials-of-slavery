It was a sudden and spontaneous reaction which took Cloppenburg by surprise. However, Cloppenburg was renowned for maltreating his slaves and admitted to the court that he had been angry. Barkat was executed by breaking on the wheel, but Cloppenburg was also reprimanded by the Council of Justice.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-4" id="summary-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The phenomenon of “running <em>amok</em>” was well attested by comtemporaries as a dangerous response of Southeast Asian slaves. It usually involved unexpected attacks on all who had the misfortune to come in the path of the perpetrator, ending with his (<em>amok</em>-runners were always male) suicide, or attempted suicide. <em>Amok</em> had supernatural significance, often involving the use of the <em>kris</em> sword, which was believed to have special spiritual powers, and took place throughout insular Southeast Asia. For general analysis of <em>amok</em>, see Spores 1988 and, for a Cape example, Bradlow 1991. Other references or examples in this volume include 1717 Aaron van Bengalen; 1739 Cupido van Mallabaar; 1751 Januarij van Boegies; 1757 Baatjoe van Mandhaar; and 1775 Maart van Bencoule. <a href="#summary-fnref-3" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>Barkat admitted guilt but stated in defence that he had been mistreated by his owner. He was sentenced to be broken on the cross with the <em>coup de grâce</em>, the sentence recommended in the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-382">eijsch</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-382"><span class="header">eijsch</span>Literally ‘claim’ or ‘demand.’ This is strictly speaking the <em>eijsch ende conclusie</em> without the final part about sentencing, but the term is often used as a shorthand for the whole document.</span></em>, CJ 349, f. 103. Nonetheless, after the sentence was carried out, the court decreed that although it had been deserved, reports had been received of Cloppenburg’s ‘al te driftige en brusque behandeling’ (rather too hot-tempered and brusque treatment) of all his slaves and that he should be admonished, CJ 26, ff. 15-6. A delegation was sent to his house to reprimand him, but two years later a similar incident happened when Galant van Mallebaar attacked Cloppenburg after he tried to flog him for staying away overnight (CJ 787, ff. 156-61). <a href="#summary-fnref-4" data-footnote-backref class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

                <div class="astro-FK3CUU5Z"><p>There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, Barkat van Timor, bondsman of the former burgher councillor, <em>Sinjeur</em> Abraham Cloppenburg, 30 years old at a guess, who, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, confesses it to be true:</p>
<p>That at about ten o’clock at night of Saturday, the 22<sup>nd</sup> of this month February, his owner came home and first went into the room to his wife, coming out again shortly thereafter when he came to the confessant, who was in the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-384">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-384"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch). In most houses this was a room, although in the later design of some Cape houses it referred to a narrower passage (like a hall or vestibule) flanked by one or more front rooms.</span></em> where he had set the table,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> and asked him why the food was not on the table, to which the confessant replied that it had not yet been ordered by him, <em>Sinjeur</em> Cloppenburg. Hereupon his said owner immediately grabbed him by the hair and, after having given him some slaps with his hand in the face, took the confessant to the kitchen, ordering some of his fellow slaves to undress him and to tie him to a ladder standing in the kitchen. Hereupon, these slaves immediately took him in order to tie him up and beat him, while in the meantime he begged his owner for forgiveness. However, as this did not help, the confessant tore himself free from the hands of these slaves, taking at this time out of desperation a knife which was lying on the table in the kitchen, and went with it to his owner, who was also still in the kitchen, being of the intention then to take his<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-2" id="d0-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> life in order thereby to depart from the world himself, because he could not bear it any longer with his owner. Hereupon he stabbed with the said knife at his aforementioned master, without knowing whether or where he had hit the same, whereupon his owner ran from the kitchen to the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-385">galderij</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-385"><span class="header">galderij</span>Not a ‘gallery,’ but usually a family room behind the public front rooms of a house where families ate together or where domestic chores were performed. In some earlier Cape houses it referred to a passageway or linking area between the front room and the kitchen area.</span></em>,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-3" id="d0-translation-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> being followed by the cook Julij who closed the kitchen door after him, while the other slaves likewise ran to the back of the yard and also closed the door after them.</p>
<p>So that the confessant then found himself alone in the kitchen and was of mind to flee to the attic, yet, when he came to the ladder he met with the slave Julij who was coming down the ladder from the attic, and since he, Julij, was in the way of the confessant, he gave him two stabs with that very same knife, without knowing whether or where he was hit. Hereupon the confessant immediately went to the attic with the knife in his hand, without knowing if he had wounded anybody else at this time.</p>
<p>That when the confessant got to the attic, after letting the ladder fall down into the kitchen, he immediately blocked off the trap-door with some chests which were in the attic, being of the intention to conceal and defend himself as long as he could, continually putting other chests in the place of those which were being worked away from underneath and also, on several occassions, threw whatever he could lay his hands upon, be it pots, bottles, stones etc., through the window of the attic to the people who had joined the others there at the house.</p>
<p>That after some time, when more and more of the chests on the trap-door were worked away, the confessant held several conversations with the people who were in the kitchen. He saw a European person in a white shirt going to the back yard to speak to the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-386">caffers</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-386"><span class="header">caffers</span>Term for the slaves and <em>bandieten</em> used as assistants of the executioner and who also acted as the ‘police force’ of the town under the leadership of the <em>geweldiger</em>. Both the function and word derived from Batavia.</span></em> who were there, which person also swore at him, for which reason the confessant took a pot and hurled it at the head of the said person.</p>
<p>That with the break of day the confessant saw that somebody, with the help of a ladder which had been set up to the window of the attic from the outside, was hacking at that window with a sharp instrument, without having seen anything more of this person than the arm and the instrument since the confessant stood to the side of the window, whereupon he stabbed two or three times in the direction of this person with a sharp broom handle which he at this time held in his hand, and also felt that this person had been hit by it. After this, the chests, which were still on the trap-door, were again worked away below into the kitchen and, while moreover shots were fired at him by Schipper Kroos – after he had managed to get the confessant in view – from a flat roof from where he could see into the attic,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-4" id="d0-translation-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> without however hitting him. Upon which the confessant became anxious, and seeing a bamboo parasol handle from which some things were hanging, he took this stick down and sharpened the one end in order to defend himself with it against those who wished to capture him. Shortly hereupon the confessant saw and heard two openings being knocked through the wall and that another opening into the attic was being made next to the trap-door, for which reason the confessant went to the corner by the chimney, where the openings were being made, holding the knife and the bamboo stick in his hands, at which point he was hit unexpectedly upon his head by a <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-387">caffer</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-387"><span class="header">caffer</span>Term for the slaves and <em>bandieten</em> used as assistants of the executioner and who also acted as the ‘police force’ of the town under the leadership of the <em>geweldiger</em>.

<p>Statement given, on the requisition of the honourable fiscal Pieter Reede van Oudshoorn, by the former burgher councillor, <em>Sieur</em> Abraham Cloppenburg, which is of the following content, namely:</p>
<p>That the testifier got home at about ten o’clock this evening<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-5" id="d0-translation-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup> and asked his wife, who was sitting in the back room reading, if the table had been set, and obtained as answer from her that the table is set in the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-391">voorhuijs</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-391"><span class="header">voorhuijs</span>Literally the ‘front house’, this referred to the first area entered from the main door or stoep (porch). In most houses this was a room, although in the later design of some Cape houses it referred to a narrower passage (like a hall or vestibule) flanked by one or more front rooms.</span></em> and that a while ago his slave Barkat van Timor had demanded the key of the silver cabinet to this end; to which the testifier replied that this had not been done. He then had the slave Barkat called into the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-392">galderij</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-392"><span class="header">galderij</span>Not a ‘gallery,’ but usually a family room behind the public front rooms of a house where families ate together or where domestic chores were performed. In some earlier Cape houses it referred to a passageway or linking area between the front room and the kitchen area.</span></em> asking him why the table had not been set, and received from him, rather insolently, the answer that the table had been set for the <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-393">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-393"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em>. Hereupon the testifier became rather angry and told the aforementioned slave Barkat that he better go to the kitchen, at once calling the slave Achilles to get a <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-394">sjambok</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-394"><span class="header">sjambok</span>This word entered seventeenth-century Dutch via Malay (<em>tjambok</em>) or Javanese (<em>sambok</em>) from Persian (<em>châbuk</em>).

Yet, instead of this, the same, with a knife which he held in his hand and which the testifier did not see, stabbed him in the middle of his chest, somewhat to the left-hand side, wounding him at the same time with that knife in his right arm. When the testifier received these wounds, he went from the kitchen to the front, without being able to say what happened further.</p>
<p>There being nothing further to declare, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, while offering to subsequently confirm this, his report, at any time, if so required.</p>

<p>That after they had been watching all night long without success, the testifier finally, when day broke on Sunday morning, climbed to the attic with the help of a ladder which had been put up to the window at the outside in order to apprehend the said slave. When he got to the attic, the testifier found the same with a knife in his hand, sitting in the corner by the chimney, looking around him; and, since the testifier was not seen by the same, he went to the aforesaid slave and gave him a sudden blow on the left arm with the stick that he had in his hand. Whereupon the said slave leaped up, grabbed the testifier and started to struggle with him, as a result of which the testifier got a cut on the left-hand side of his neck from the said slave with the knife that he held in his hand; and when this slave was again lifting up his hand in order to stab the testifier for a second time, with him trying to prevent this as far as possible and calling for help, he was freed by his colleagues and, coming down from the attic, immediately had himself bandaged.</p>
<p>There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, being willing to subsequently confirm this, his report, at any time, if so required.</p>
