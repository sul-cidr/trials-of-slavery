  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>One night in 1735, several runaway Company slaves, who had been hiding for several months on Table Mountain, stole sheep from various farms and corrals in and around Cape Town. It is not clear whether they all belonged to the same group, but some were spotted by a slave shepherd and a <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-151">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-151"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> at one of the corrals and they were all captured by the <em>ratelwacht</em>, the night watch that guarded the town.</p>
<p>Table Mountain was a well-known refuge for runaway slaves throughout the eighteenth century.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> This case shows some of the ways in which they tried to obtain food in the town, and also the dangers they faced from the town militia, as well as slaves and <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-152">knechten</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-152"><span class="header">knechten</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> stationed on the properties they raided.</p>
<p>The court records for this case contain eight testimonies by all of those involved.

They then went together to the garden and stood in front of the corral of the aforementioned Jan de With, which corral the said Cupido entered by jumping over the wall and, having grabbed and tied up a sheep there, Cupido threw that sheep over the wall to him, after which Cupido, at the opposite side of the corral, jumped over the wall to the outside. While the confessant was picking up that sheep in order to carry it away, he heard a noise and saw some <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-156">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-156"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>Today, 13 May 1735, there appears before me, Josephus de Grandpreez, secretary of the honourable Council of Justice of the Castle of Good Hope, in the presence of the witnesses named below, the soldier Jan Plat, of competent age, assigned as <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-157">knecht</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-157"><span class="header">knecht</span>Literally ‘male servant,’ but because most European <em>knechten</em> at the Cape were used as slave overseers, this original meaning gradually eroded and the word ended up meaning primarily (as in modern Afrikaans), ‘farm foreman.’</span></em> to the former burgher councillor, <em>Sieur</em> Jan de Wit, and who lives in the same’s garden, who, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, <em>Meester</em> Daniel van den Henghel, declares it to be the genuine truth:</p>
<p>That at 2 o’clock during the night of last Saturday, which was the 7<sup>th</sup> of this current month May, the deponent was roused by the shepherd of the aforesaid Jan de Wit [<em>sic</em>], named Januarij, who came to tell him that a black <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-158">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-158"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

Upon receiving this report, the deponent at once went outside with some slaves, which is when these two black <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-160">jongens</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-160"><span class="header">jongens</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

However, one of them was immediately caught by the slaves of the aforementioned Jan de Wit, which captured slave, the deponent, when he took him to prison the following morning, heard being called “Claas” by the honourable Company’s slaves, and also that the same was one of the bondsmen of the honourable Company.</p>
<p>There being nothing further to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his deposition as in the text, and offers, if so required, to subsequently confirm it with solemn oaths.</p>
<p>Thus recorded at the office of the Secretary of Justice of the Cape of Good Hope, in the presence of the clerks Joachim Nicolaus van Dessin and Frans Augustus Haaks, as witnesses.</p>

<p>That last Saturday, at 2 o’clock in the night, the deponent, lying awake in the corral, saw jumping into it over its wall a black <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-162">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-162"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age. At the Cape, however, this usage was extended to slaves and then became exclusive, so that <em>jongen</em> (also in the deflected form <em>jong</em>) came to mean ‘male slave’, such that Afrikaans lost the use of the word to mean ‘boy’ and instead uses <em>seun</em> (from Dutch <em>zoon</em>) for both ‘boy’ and ‘son.’ In this primary meaning, the word has become obsolete in modern Afrikaans, except for the archaic terms <em>tuinjong</em> (‘garden boy’) and <em>plaasjong</em> (‘farm boy’), in the sense of male workers of colour.</span></em> who immediately took a sheep from the flock, tied up its legs and then threw it over the wall to another black <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-163">jongen</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-163"><span class="header">jongen</span>Literally ‘boy.’ In Dutch it was common to use this word also to refer to male servants, irrespective of age.

<p>Copy:</p>
<p>There appears before us, the undersigned delegates from the honourable Council of Justice of this government, Kinsa van Madagascar, slave of the honourable Company, 33 years old at a guess, who, on the requisition of the honourable independent fiscal, <em>Meester</em> Daniel van den Henghel, confesses it to be true:</p>
<p>That the confessant, now about three months ago, had run away and then stayed on the mountain above the honourable Company’s <em>schuur</em><sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-2" id="d0-translation-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> in the company of 11 other slaves of the honourable Company and a <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-170">meijd</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-170"><span class="header">meijd</span>Literally ‘girl.’ This word developed among the same lines as <em>jongen</em>, the word coming to mean ‘female slave.’ However, its trajectory diverged from that of <em>jongen</em> in that it eventually was used more widely to refer to indigenous women, so that <em>meid</em> still survives in modern Afrikaans as a pejorative term for women of colour. As with <em>jongen</em>, the word was no longer available to refer to European girls, but instead of the difference between girl and daughter disappearing, the diminutive form, <em>meijsje</em> (Afrikaans, <em>meisie</em>), came to be used for ‘girl.’</span></em>, named Lea van Madagascar, which is where they maintained themselves and obtained food by chopping wood and afterwards going to sell it.</p>
<p>That last Wednesday night at 11 o’clock the confessant, together with a fellow slave of the honourable Company, named Valentijn, who was previously assigned to the stables, came here to the Cape, when the aforesaid Valentijn jumped into the corral of the widow of Servaas de Kok, from which he took two sheep and gave them to him; with which they, each carrying one, went through the Cape<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-3" id="d0-translation-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> in order to take these two sheep to their hiding place, being met between the house of the burgher Tielman and the houses of the honourable Company by the <em>ratelwacht</em><sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-4" id="d0-translation-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> who took the confessant prisoner; while the slave Valentijn took flight, though leaving the sheep that he was carrying behind.</p>
<p>Thus confessed at the Cape of Good Hope on the first of November 1734.</p>
