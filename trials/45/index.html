  <div class="astro-LMWD7RQC"><p>The sixteen-year-old slave Jephta caused great affront when he pushed his way through the crowd of high-ranking Company officials at the entrance to the church, to bring his master his coat. The episode gives an unusual glimpse of the duties of the private slave of officials and their sensitivity to their dignity.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-1" id="summary-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> It moreover illustrates how sensitive contemporary society was to issues of rank and status.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-2" id="summary-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> Jephta was charged with insolence and publicly whipped.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-3" id="summary-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The case had an extraordinary aftermath, as on the afternoon of the event Jephta’s mistress, Martha Solliers, went to the fiscal’s house and verbally abused him for arresting her slave. This resulted in a long-drawn-out civil case in which the fiscal sued her for insulting his person and office.<sup><a href="#summary-fn-4" id="summary-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup></p>

<p>That on the morning of Sunday, which was the 4<sup>th</sup> of this current month August, after the service had been concluded, when the honourable fiscal, together with the rest of the church congregation, wanted to proceed home from the Lord’s house here, and had already, along with the said congregation, got to the inside portal of the church: the prisoner, provided with a coat and parasol, thought it good to push between – with much rudeness and almost with force or fury – the honourable fiscal and some of his fellow principal lords of this government,<sup><a href="#d0-translation-fn-1" id="d0-translation-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> and their wives as well as a throng of other <em>juffrouwen</em>, who were all leaving the church together, into the church, on account of which the honourable fiscal then, thinking at first that this rude intrusion performed by the prisoner was done purely out of ignorance, pushed the prisoner from him, while saying: “Scoundrel, get out of the church!”, expecting that the prisoner would guiltily obey this, but far from it. That the prisoner thereupon, not only for the second time pushed against the said honourable fiscal with one and the same insolence, and for which he was given a blow by his honour with his cane, but that he also, since he could not find any space to push through at the side of the honourable fiscal, insolently dared to attempt entering the church on the other side of the portal, but was seen doing this by the honourable fiscal. That the congregation leaving the church was much annoyed by the extraordinary rudeness of the prisoner, and therefore the congregation was told by his honour that they must let this boy go out of the church, but the prisoner finally dared to go so far by also snarling, very insolently: “Well, must I not bring the coat of my <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-544">sinjeur</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-544"><span class="header">sinjeur</span>It is uncertain whether <em>sinjeur</em> came into colonial Dutch from French <em>seigneur</em> or Creole Portuguese <em>sinjoor</em> (both from Latin, <em>senior</em>, ‘older’). The word was commonly used by slaves at the Cape to address European males but was also the official title for lower-ranking VOC officials. The word lived on in Afrikaans in the form of <em>seur</em> until the early twentieth century but is now obsolete.</span></em>?”; which insolence, however, the prisoner came to regret in the end when he heard publicly from the honourable fiscal that he would soon be found and brought to prison by a <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-545">caffer</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-545"><span class="header">caffer</span>Term for the slaves and <em>bandieten</em> used as assistants of the executioner and who also acted as the ‘police force’ of the town under the leadership of the <em>geweldiger</em>. Both the function and word derived from Batavia.</span></em>, as the prisoner then very suddenly, with a tearful countenance, prayed for forgiveness from the aforementioned honourable fiscal, while promising never to do this again, but with which his honour – since it was not only him alone but also the church congregation who got greatly distressed by such a vile scoundrel – can in no ways be content, and then had the prisoner apprehended and riveted in chains.</p>
<p>And since insolencies and bold brutalities like the ones committed can under no circumstances be tolerated, but should be punished exemplarily as a deterrent to other similar vile scoundrels.</p>
<p>Thus it is that honourable Council of Justice, aforementioned, serving today, having seen and read with attention the written <em><span class="glossary" aria-describedby="glossary-546">crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie</span><span class="gloss" role="tooltip" id="glossary-546"><span class="header">crimineelen eijsch ende conclusie</span>Literally ‘criminal demand and conclusion.’ The document drawn up by the prosecutor based on the evidence he collected and delivered in court against an accused.
